Support reading and writing data from files in common formats\n2. Improve LINQ support\n\n# Reading and Writing text, json, jsonl, and csv\n\nThe large feature additions of this release include functions to natively read and write from text, json, jsonl, and csv files. Details on the issue can be found at #19. The examples on the `README.md` page illustrate how these can be used and their usefulness. A full list of changes can be found in `CHANGELOG.md` or the copy of it at the bottom of the release notes.\n\n# LINQ\n\nIn doing research I found that a common use case where `ScalaFunctional` could be helpful is in doing LINQ-like data manipulation. To better serve this group of users functions like `select` and `where` were added, and documentation was improved to cover this use case.\n\n# Breaking Changes\n\nThe bug detailed at #44 exposed that `fold_left` and `fold_right` was using the passed function incorrectly. This was corrected, but is a breaking change to all prior versions.\n\n# 0.4.1 enum34 Removed\n\nIn the release of 0.4.0 a issue was found where the wheel built with python2 contained enum34 which broke the python3 installation. If it were built with python3, then it would not include enum34 causing problems with python2. The solution was to remove enum34 and use vanilla python instead.\n\n# Changelog\n\n## Release 0.4.0\n\n### New Features\n- Official and tested support for python 3.5. Thus `ScalaFunctional` is tested on Python 2.7, 3.3,\n  3.4, 3.5, pypy, and pypy3\n- `aggregate` from LINQ\n- `order_by` from LINQ\n- `where` from LINQ\n- `select` from LINQ\n- `average` from LINQ\n- `sum` modified to allow LINQ projected sum\n- `product` modified to allow LINQ projected product\n- `seq.jsonl` to read jsonl files\n- `seq.json` to read json files\n- `seq.open` to read files\n- `seq.csv` to read csv files\n- `seq.range` to create range sequences\n- `Sequence.to_jsonl` to save jsonl files\n- `Sequence.to_json` to save json files\n- `Sequence.to_file` to save files\n- `Sequence.to_csv` to save csv files\n- Improved documentation with more examples and mention LINQ explicitly\n- Change PyPi keywords to improve discoverability\n- Created [Google groups mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scalafunctional)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- `fold_left` and `fold_right` had incorrect order of arguments for passed function\n\n## Release 0.4.1\n\nFix python 3 build error due to wheel installation of enum34. Package no longer depends on enum34\n\n# Contributors\n\nThank you to [adrian17](https://github.com/adrian17) for contributing `seq.range` to the release.\n"}

Additionally, there were additional API additions and several minor breaking changes.\n\n# Performance Improvements\n\nThe largest under the hood change is changing all operations to be lazy by default. `0.2.0` calculates a new list at every transformation. This was initially implemented using generators, but this could lead to unexpected behavior. The problem with this approach is highlighted in #20. Code sample below:\n\n``` python\nfrom functional import seq\ndef gen():\n    for e in range(5):\n    yield e\n\nnums = gen()\ns = seq(nums)\ns.map(lambda x: x * 2).sum()\n# prints 20\ns.map(lambda x: x * 2).sum()\n# prints 0\ns = seq([1, 2, 3, 4])\na = s.map(lambda x: x * 2)\na.sum()\n# prints 20\na.sum()\n# prints 0\n```\n\nEither, `ScalaFunctional` would need to aggressively cache results or a new approach was needed. That approach is called lineage. The basic concept is that `ScalaFunctional`:\n1. Tracks the most recent concrete data (eg list of objects)\n2. Tracks the list of transformations that need to be applied to the list to find the answer\n3. Whenever an expression is evaluated, the result is cached for (1) and returned\n\nThe result is the problems above are fixed, below is an example showing how the backend calculates results:\n\n``` python\nfrom functional import seq\n\nIn [8]: s = seq(1, 2, 3, 4)\n\nIn [9]: s._lineage\nOut[9]: Lineage: sequence\n\nIn [10]: s0 = s.map(lambda x: x * 2)\n\nIn [11]: s0._lineage\nOut[11]: Lineage: sequence -> map(<lambda>)\n\nIn [12]: s0\nOut[12]: [2, 4, 6, 8]\n\nIn [13]: s0._lineage\nOut[13]: Lineage: sequence -> map(<lambda>) -> cache\n```\n\nNote how initially, since the expression is not evaluated, it is not cached. Since printing `s0` in the repl calls `__repr__`, it is evaluated and cached so it is not recomputed if `s0` is used again. You can also call `cache()` directly if desired. You may also notice that `seq` can now take a list of arguments like `list` (added in #27).\n\n# Next up\n\nImprovements in documentation and redo of `README.md`. Next release will be focused on extending `ScalaFunctional` further to work with other data input/output and more usability improvements. This release also marks relative stability in the collections API. Everything that seemed worth porting from Scala/Spark has been completed with a few additions (predominantly left, right, inner, and outer joins). There aren't currently any foreseeable breaking changes.\n"}
