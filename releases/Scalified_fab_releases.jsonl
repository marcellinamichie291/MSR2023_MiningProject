Added Ripple Effect - [**issue #2: ripple effect**](https://github.com/shell-software/fab/issues/2). Disabled by default.\n   See [**README.md**](https://github.com/shell-software/fab/blob/master/README.md) for more info\n2. Added Shadow Responsive Effect - [**issue #11: Question - Pressed State**](https://github.com/shell-software/fab/issues/11). Enabled by default.\n   See [**README.md**](https://github.com/shell-software/fab/blob/master/README.md) for more info\n3. Added possibility to move the **Action Button** - [**issue #9: Move button up and down**](https://github.com/shell-software/fab/issues/9). \n   See [**README.md**](https://github.com/shell-software/fab/blob/master/README.md) for more info\n4. **Action Button** now has a dependency on an external [**ViewMover**](https://github.com/shell-software/view-mover) library. \n   If it is used already in the project it must be excluded as a transitive dependency\n5. Changed the **Action Button** default values:\n   1. Button default color for **NORMAL** state changed from **Color.LTGRAY** to **#FF9B9B9B**\n   2. Button default color for **PRESSED** state changed from **Color.DKGRAY** to **#FF696969**\n   3. Shadow default color changed from **#757575** to **#42000000** according to Material Design Guidelines\n   4. Shadow default radius changed from **2.0f** to **8.0f** (in density-independent pixels)\n   5. Shadow default X-axis offset changed from **1.0f** to **0.0f** (in density-independent pixels)\n   6. Shadow default Y-axis offset changed from **1.5f** to **8.0f** (in density-independent pixels)\n6. **New** public methods, classes and attributes:\n   1. Methods:\n      - **setSize(float)** - sets the size of the **Action Button** (in density-independent pixels).\n        Changing the default size of the button breaks the rules of [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html).\n        Setting the button size explicitly means, that button types with its default sizes are completely ignored. Do not use this method, unless you know what you are doing\n      - **getSize()** - returns the size of the **Action Button** in real pixels (the same as **getButtonSize()**, which is now marked as _deprecated_).\n      - **move(MovingParams)** - moves the **Action Button** to the specified position obtained from **MovingParams** object\n      - **moveRight(float)** - moves the **Action Button** right to a specified distance (in density-independent pixels)\n      - **moveDown(float)** - moves the **Action Button** down to a specified distance (in density-independent pixels)\n      - **moveLeft(float)** - moves the **Action Button** left to a specified distance (in density-independent pixels)\n      - **moveUp(float)** - moves the **Action Button** up to a specified distance (in density-independent pixels)\n      - **isRippleEffectEnabled()** - checks whether **Action Button** Ripple Effect enabled\n      - **setRippleEffectEnabled(boolean)** - toggles the Ripple Effect state\n      - **getButtonColorRipple()** - returns the **Action Button** Ripple Effect color\n      - **setButtonColorRipple(int)** - sets the **Action Button** Ripple Effect color\n      - **isShadowResponsiveEffectEnabled()** - returns whether Shadow Responsive Effect enabled\n      - **setShadowResponsiveEffectEnabled(boolean)** - sets the Shadow Responsive Effect\n      - **getTouchPoint()** - returns the **Action Button** touch point\n   2. XML attributes:\n      - **size** - dimension, declares the button size (the same as **setSize(float)**)\n      - **BIG** - enum (value **2**), declares the **Action Button** **BIG** type, which has the size of **72.0dp** (the same as **setType(ActionButton.Type.BIG)**)\n      - **rippleEffect_enabled** - boolean, enables the **Action Button** Ripple Effect (the same as **setRippleEffectEnabled(boolean)**)\n      - **button_colorRipple** - color, declares the **Action Button** Ripple Effect color (the same as **setButtonColorRipple(int)**)\n      - **shadowResponsiveEffect_enabled** - boolean, enables the **Action Button** Shadow Responsive Effect (the same as **setShadowResponsiveEffectEnabled(boolean)**)\n   3. Classes:\n      - added new **Action Button** type - **ActionButton.Type.BIG**, which has a size of **_72**_ density-independent pixels. Also added a correspondent value **BIG** to **type** XML attribute\n        ([Pull request #16: _Added BIG size, 72dp size for fab buttons, Fix MOVE feedback, update gitignore_](https://github.com/shell-software/fab/pull/16) by [**Aracem**](https://github.com/Aracem))\n      - **TouchPoint** - an entity class, which contains the information about X- and Y-axis coordinates of the touch point (can't be instantiated).\n7. **Attention!** _Deprecated_ methods:\n   - **getButtonSize()** renamed to **getSize()**. You can still use **getButtonSize()** method, however it is marked as _deprecated_ and will be removed in version 2.0.0.\n8. Added checking of the _X_ and _Y_ touch points coordinates\n   - If the touch _X_ and _Y_ coordinates are not inside the main button circle, the button won't react on click\n   - If the button state is **PRESSED** and touch point moves outside the main circle the button state changes to **NORMAL** \n     ([Pull request #14: _Update ActionButton.java_](https://github.com/shell-software/fab/pull/14) by [**uriel-frankel**](https://github.com/uriel-frankel))\n"}
