As the project is growing it is my hope to further spread the costs of maintaining the infrastructure across the users. Remember that Unmanic is a community driven project and you can also unlock supporter features by simply contributing to the [Unmanic GitHub](https://github.com/Unmanic) (including documentation) or by participating in supporting via [Discord](https://unmanic.app/discord). Thank you to everyone who has been contributing to this project. Without you, Unmanic would not be what it is today.\r\n\r\n## Service\r\n- [NEW] Added ability to configure a library as a remote-only library for receiving remote tasks.\r\n- [NEW] Added the ability for a link to push any missing library configs, including installed plugins, plugin flow and plugin settings, to remote installations.\r\n- [NEW] Updated linking to send only the relative path to a file if the remote library is configured to point to the same directory as the main installation's library. Use this feature to pull new tasks from a SMB or NFS share rather than having Unmanic transfer the file from the main installation to the remote one.\r\n- [IMPR] Reduced the number of times plugin repos are refreshed to check for updates.\r\n- [IMPR] Included the library config in API calls for requesting all libraries.\r\n- [IMPR] Added better logging for any issues found during linking communications.\r\n- [IMPR] Remove checksum validation from post-processing. Checksum generation was slowing down the processes unnecessarily.\r\n- [IMPR] Make checksum validation optional on link task file transfers.\r\n- [IMPR] Sort libraries alphabetically. Libraries are now scanned top-down in alphabetical order. Use the library name to configure the priority order in which a library is scanned.\r\n- [IMPR] Made the number of pre-loaded tasks user configurable rather than calculating it based on the number of available remote workers.\r\n- [IMPR] Improvements to building, starting and stopping Unmanic on Windows.\r\n- [FIX] Removed the `--unmanic_path` cli option for setting the config directory. Use the `HOME_DIR` environment variable instead.\r\n- [FIX] Fixed bug where tags would not be saved on new worker group creation.\r\n- [FIX] Fixed bug where a link may not be configurable in the first 10 seconds after first creating it.\r\n- [FIX] Fixed issue where plugin settings were not being set during the import or clone of a library.\r\n- [FIX] Fixed bug where clicking submit on the link settings screen would always enable task pre-loading on each of the links.\r\n- [FIX] Fixed a bug where if the remote pending task list is empty, the main installation would not detect that the task has been deleted.\r\n\r\n## Plugin executor\r\n- [NEW] Added a the final cache path as a variable handed to post-processor plugins.\r\n\r\n## Docker\r\n- [NEW] Included NodeJS in build.\r\n- [NEW] Included exiftool in build.\r\n- [NEW] Added libmediainfo0v5.\r\n- [IMPR] Updated Intel dependencies.\r\n- [IMPR] Updated Jellyfin FFmpeg to v4.4.1-4.\r\n\r\n## Front-end\r\n- [IMPR] Display the library config overview on the library settings screen.\r\n- [IMPR] Display the link config overview on the link settings screen.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unmanic/unmanic/releases/68651996/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

Apply tags to libraries and worker to further customise that partnership. Eg. Tag a library with \"priority\" and keep a matching tagged worker spare for priority tasks.\r\n- [NEW] Add the ability to link with an installation that is behind a proxy (traefik, swag/nginx, etc.) configured with basic authentication.\r\n- [NEW] Add ability to set the maximum number of days that the completed tasks should be kept. If enabled, Unmanic will remove successfully completed tasks after the configured number of days.\r\n- [IMPR] Session reloads with the Unmanic site API are now reduced and persisted between application restarts. Unmanic can operate in a supporter tier without an internet connection for up to seven days.\r\n- [IMPR] All sub-processes executed by workers will now be executed at a lower priority than the main application. This should help improve application responsiveness during times of high CPU load.\r\n- [IMPR] When configured to send tasks to remote installations, Unmanic will now send one transfer at a time, but be available to receive up to two transfers back from that remote installation. This should help to saturate network bandwidth for people with faster networks.\r\n- [IMPR] Remote linking will now poll for updates from a remote installation every 10 seconds (previously 30). This will reduce the delays between a task finishing and the source installation seeing it as available to download.\r\n- [IMPR] Reduce the number of file copies during a task lifcycle by first attempting an atomic movement for the final file movement of the post-processor from the cache directory. If the cache directory and destination directory are on different mounts, Unmanic will fall back to a file copy.\r\n- [IMPR] Carry out post-processor file movements with a '.unmanic.part' suffix added to the end of the file as it is moved.\r\n- [IMPR] Improvements to application logging.\r\n- [IMPR] Improvements to the how application settings are saved to file.\r\n- [FIX] Fix a minor issue with the way that the main service exits when a termination request is given.\r\n- [FIX] Fix for bug in post-processor where, under certain circumstances, if a file movement failed it could cause the post-processor thread to crash.\r\n- [FIX] Fix a bug where removing a library while a task is about to be processed by a worker could crash the main worker foreman thread.\r\n\r\n## Plugin executor\r\n- [FIX] Fix error causing plugin settings to fail during write if no global settings file exists\r\n\r\n## Front-end\r\n- [NEW] Display release notes on dashboard the first time the UI is opened after a release update.\r\n- [NEW] Add form elements presenting worker group settings.\r\n- [NEW] Add form elements for configuring library and worker tags.\r\n- [NEW] Add form elements for configuring basic auth credentials in remote installation linking.\r\n- [NEW] Add form elements for configuring completed tasks management.\r\n- [NEW] Add ability to filter the completed tasks list by success status.\r\n- [NEW] Add ability to filter the completed tasks list by the date that the task was completed.\r\n- [IMPR] Display more information on the list of configured libraries in settings so we can see at a glance how each library is configured.\r\n- [IMPR] Update all front-end dependencies for improvements, bug-fixes and security patches.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unmanic/unmanic/releases/65752704/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}
