You can use pydap to access scientific data on the internet without having to download it; instead, you work with special array and iterable objects that download data on-the-fly as necessary, saving bandwidth and time. The module also comes with a robust-but-lightweight Opendap server, implemented as a WSGI application.\r\n\r\nFor more details, and complete documentation, see https://github.com/pydap/pydap.\r\n\r\n## New This Release\r\n\r\n* Drop support for Python 2. Support is tested for Python starting with version 3.6 (see #237).\r\n* Fixed deprecation warnings (see #245, #232).\r\n* Fixed __getitem__ test failure missing 1 required positional argument: 'user_charset' (see #224).\r\n* Fixed module 'pydap' has no attribute '__version__' problem (see #206).\r\n* Added GitHub CI (see #244).\r\n* pydap now runs with python 3.10.\r\n* Many more changes - see repo for more details.\r\n\r\nGet the release here: https://github.com/pydap/pydap/archive/refs/tags/3.3.0.tar.gz.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pydap/pydap/releases/58284393/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}
