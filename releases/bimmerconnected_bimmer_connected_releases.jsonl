If you are using this library in your custom code, it will most likely affect you in one of the following functions:\r\n  * `bimmer_connected.account.ConnectedDriveAccount.get_vehicles()`\r\n  * `bimmer_connected.remote_services.RemoteServices.trigger_[any-remote-service]()`\r\n  * `bimmer_connected.vehicle.ConnectedDriveVehicle.get_vehicle_image()`\r\n* Initialization of `ConnectedDriveAccount` does not automatically get the vehicles from the API, use `get_vehicles()`:\r\n  ```python\r\n  account = ConnectedDriveAccount(USERNAME, PASSWORD, REGION)\r\n  await account.get_vehicles()\r\n  ```\r\n* `bimmer_connected.country_selector` has been removed in favor of `bimmer_connected.api.regions` \r\n* `VehicleStatus` is now deprecated. All of the information is available via `ConnectedDriveVehicles` attributes. You will see a logged `DeprecationWarning` everytime your code accesses a deprecated property.\r\n* While not offically supported before, Python<3.6 is now broken\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* Fully refactored the library, functionality should stay the same (except for above breaking changes)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bimmerconnected/bimmer_connected/releases/59968000/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}
