In particular, I have updated all the constants that were missing in py3nvml and existing in the NVIDIA source as of version 418.43. In addition, I have wrapped all of these constants in Enums so it is easier to see what constants go together. Finally, for all the functions in py3nvml.py3nvml I have copied in the C docstring. While this will result in some strange looking docstrings which will be slightly incorrect, they should give good guidance on the scope of the function, something which was ill-defined before.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will remove the py3nvml.nvidia_smi module in a future version, as I believe it was only ever meant as an example of how to use the nvml functions to query the gpus, and is now quite out of date. To get the same functionality, you can call nvidia-smi -q -x from python with subprocess."}
