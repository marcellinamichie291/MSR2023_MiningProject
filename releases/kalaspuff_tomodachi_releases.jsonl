Note that this is a change in default behaviour and may be a breaking change if \"non-competing\" services were used. This change was triggered in an attempt to make the API more clear and use more common default values. It's rare that a non-shared queue would be used for service replicas of the same type in a distributed architecture.\r\n* The event loop that the process will execute on can now be specified on startup using `--loop [auto|asyncio|uvloop]`, currently the `auto` (or `default`) value will use Python's builtin `asyncio` event loop. Note that this is a change in behaviour and the default event loop will now be `asyncio` instead of `uvloop`.\r\n* Dropped support for Python 3.6.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* HTTP server functionality, which is based on `aiohttp`, can now be configured to allow keep-alive connections by specifying the `options.http.keepalive_timeout` config value.\r\n* The `@tomodachi.aws_sns_sqs` decorator can now specify a `filter_policy` which will be applied on the SNS subscription (for the specified topic and queue) as the `\"FilterPolicy` attribute. This will apply a filter on SNS messages using the chosen \"message attributes\" and/or their values specified in the filter. Example: A filter policy value of `{\"event\": [\"order_paid\"], \"currency\": [\"EUR\", \"USD\"]}` would set up the SNS subscription to receive messages on the topic only where the message attribute `\"event\"` is `\"order_paid\"` and the `\"currency\"` value is either `\"EUR\"` or `\"USD\"`. If `filter_policy` is not specified as an argument, the queue will receive messages on the topic as per already specified if using an existing subscription, or receive all messages on the topic if a new subscription is set up (default). Changing the `filter_policy` on an existing subscription may take several minutes to propagate. Read more about the filter policy format on AWS, since it doesn't follow the same pattern as specifying message attributes. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-subscription-filter-policies.html\r\n* Related to the above mentioned filter policy, the `aws_sns_sqs_publish` function has also been updated with the possibility to specify said \"message attributes\" using the `message_attributes` keyword argument. Values should be specified as a simple `dict` with keys and values. Example: `{\"event\": \"order_paid\", \"paid_amount\": 100, \"currency\": \"EUR\"}`.\r\n* Added SSL and virtualhost settings to AMQP transport, as well as additional configuration options which can be passed via `options.amqp.virtualhost`, `options.amqp.ssl` and `options.amqp.heartbeat`. (github: **xdmiodz**)\r\n* Added `tomodachi.get_execution_context()` that holds metadata about the service execution that can be used for debugging purposes or be sent to application monitoring platforms such as Sentry or to be included in custom log output for log search indexing. The `tomodachi.get_execution_context()` function returns a `dict` with installed package versions of some key dependencies, function call counters of different types, etc.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Fixes a bug that could cause a termination signal to stop the service in the middle of processing a message received via AWS SQS. The service will now await currently executing tasks before finally shutting down.\r\n* Service termination for HTTP based services will now correctly await started tasks from clients that has disconnected before receiving the response.\r\n* Functions decorated with `@tomodachi.aws_sns_sqs` will now be called with the `queue_url`, `receipt_handle` and `message_attributes` keyword arguments if specified in the function signature. These can be used to update the visibility timeouts, among other things.\r\n\r\n## Deprecation notice\r\n* The `message_protocol` value that can be specified on service classes has been renamed to `message_envelope` and the two example implementations `JsonBase` and `ProtobufBase` has been moved from `tomodachi.protocol` to `tomodachi.envelope`. The previous imports and service attribute is deprecated, but can still be used. Likewise the optional `message_protocol` keyword argument passed to `@tomodachi.aws_sns_sqs`, `@tomodachi.amqp`, `aws_sns_sqs_publish`, `amqp_publish` is renamed to `message_envelope`.\r\n* The service class decorator `@tomodachi.service` is now considered deprecated and the service classes should inherit from the `tomodachi.Service` class instead. This also works better with type-hinting, which currently cannot handle decorators that modify a class.\r\n\r\n## Documentation update\r\n* Overall updated documentation and improved examples around running services within Docker. \r\n* https://tomodachi.dev/docs\r\n\r\n## Minor changes\r\n* Updated identifiers for support of Python 3.9.\r\n* More verbose output when waiting for active tasks during termination.\r\n* Updated startup output with additional information about the running process, including versions, etc.\r\n* Added `aiodns` as an optional installation, as it's recommended for running DNS resolution on the event loop when using `aiohttp`.\r\n* `uvloop` is now an optional installation.\r\n* The argument to specify `message_envelope` on the `@tomodachi.aws_sns_sqs` and `@tomodachi.amqp` decorators is now keyword only.\r\n* The arguments to specify `message_envelope` and `topic_prefix` to `aws_sns_sqs_publish` is now keyword only.\r\n* The arguments to specify `message_envelope` and `routing_key_prefix` to `amqp_publish` is now keyword only.\r\n* The `name` attribute is no longer required on the service classes and if not specified the value will now instead default to `\"service\"`.\r\n* Added support for `aiohttp` 3.6.x.\r\n* Added support for `aiobotocore` 1.x.x.\r\n\r\n## Code style / CI / Contributions\r\n* Refactoring and updates to code formatting, now using Black code style.\r\n* `requirements.txt` is no more and has been replaced with `pyproject.toml` with a Poetry section together with the `poetry.lock`.\r\n* Replaced Travis CI with GitHub actions.\r\n* Replaced py-up with GitHub's dependabot, which as of recently also supports Poetry's lock files."}
