However, although in real systems the FOV is always finite, it is not the case in small systems with infinite diameters, often used to get started with calculations. This led to confusion, because imageSize was infinite with no Field Stop is present (at least two finite diameter elements).  So now, imageSize will offer to use the finite `objectHeight` of `ImagingPath` for the calculation if the FOV is infinite.  It is a new parameter `imageSize(useObject=False)` that defaults to the same behaviour as before.\r\n* Documentation has been improved significantly: better figures (up to date), syntax coloring on graphs\r\n* Example code is now distributed with the module and is accessible with `import raytracing.examples`\r\n* And all the goodies of 1.3.4"}

Documentation explains how you can include your own materials and they will be included in the search.\r\n2. All achromats now also include a new function called `showChromaticAberrations`.  If you write:\r\n   ```\r\n   from raytracing import *\r\n   thorlabs.AC254_100_A().showChromaticAberrations()\r\n   wavelengths, shifts = thorlabs.AC254_100_A().focalShifts()\r\n   ```\r\n   you get the graph of the focal shift or you can get the values directly.  They reproduce the Thorlabs graphs perfectly.\r\n3. A new class called `ZMXReader` to read a ZMX file and get the lens from it. it has been tested with files from Thorlabs and Edmund, and they match the implemented classes. It can return a `MatrixGroup` that you can use as a element in an `ImagingPath` for instance. Some work will be done soon to integrate this knowledge better, validate lenses, etc...\r\n4. The ZMXReader can actually list the lens \"prescription\" in text so you can see what it is without necessariy using `raytracing`.\r\n5. Any `Material` class derived by the user is included in the `findBy` functions, therefore the ZMXReader will make use of your material to build the lens. If a material is missing, you can add it to your script and it will be considered.
