This MarkHolder uses `hidden classes` which allows creating classes at runtime with custom storage sizes, without giving up constant propagation in the compiler.  The trade off is additional memory per thread for the additional class structure.  This can be tested by setting a system property (e.g. `-Dio.perfmark.PerfMark.markHolderProvider=io.perfmark.java15.SecretHiddenClassMarkHolderProvider.HiddenClassMarkHolderProvider`) (  5fa4adf1c40baf87ae2bf021fb9e6162821b6b2d )\r\n\r\n\r\n## General Improvements\r\n- PerfMark disables itself safely now in the event of a strict Security Manager.  (tests: 45de84d7d9d812115fa160b2448d686a4217d60e)\r\n- Debug logging was modified to use reflection, to avoid accidentally loading classes, even if `io.perfmark.Perfmark.debug` was set to false. \r\n This also avoid accidentally requiring the `java.logging` module (4f87fb72c2077df6ade958b524d6d217766c9f93, 957986dd76e9bad5891614d710a3186da900d7f0)\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* The Automatic Module Name for `java6`, `java7` jars were changed to `javasix` and `javaseven` respectively.   Auto module naming has trouble working with packages that end in numbers, as it conflicts with the version detection.   `javanine` was already set correctly."}

This uses [Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev/) which can help in reducing the large jar size that the `traceviewer` subproject uses. ( c1f3f634379809c40cfd1334f4c7743a5b97f57f )\r\n* `TaskCloseable` is now stabilized ( ac7249129e4b47d5fbf522fa4a36fb933412f971 )\r\n* Added JPMS Support (Java 9 Modules) via `Automatic-Module-Name`  ( 6a9145717e836d2e1e199488639521a7237603ec )\r\n\r\n\r\n## Behavior Changes\r\n### Class Loading \r\n\r\n* Avoid using `java.util.Logger` if possible.  This reduces the class load time (18ms -> 9ms) and memory usage. ( be6ddaf9c221b26de519370a2a16de0ff58236c9 , cf43b050a66035309872a939d9d78333c92a5f81 )\r\n* Logging can be re-enabled by setting the system property `io.perfmark.Perfmark.debug=true`, which is useful for diagnosing failures to load.\r\n* Only a single implementation of `Generator` and `MarkHolderProvider` are loaded, rather than loading all available implementations.\r\n* PerfMark is more cautious about failing during static initialization.  It now safely disables itself if any problems are encountered.\r\n\r\n### Memory Usage\r\n* PerfMark keeps all trace info in a thread-local buffer, with the expectation that the data would be read asynchronously.  Because it was\r\n    not clear if/when the data would read later, the life time of the trace data was limitted to the lifetime of the thread.   When the \r\n    thread exited, the *next* call to read the trace data would consume and delete it.  Since it was still unclear how often this would be\r\n    consumed, every new thread created would also delete the data of any other dead threads.  \r\n    \r\n    This has been changed to keep the trace data around (but not the thread) for as long as there is available memory (via a SoftReference).\r\n    If a thread is dead, and a major GC cycle happens, the trace data will be cleared.   This also means that for applications which do not\r\n    have major GC's frequently, the memory usage will appear to be higher.  The purpose of this change is to ensure the trace data for \r\n    recently deceased threads can be consumed, rather than it being removed before it could be read. ( b6d650fb38fd0970556c86daf6ab9c5e87b16df8 )\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n* Improved the documentation in several places, describing key concepts in the Javadocs ( 4ea4529101f6cc7744e82b45400d0e727644f517 , e248396ea7ac4860a318fc96be71ad0945d8e708)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixed a race condition where the Java6 storage was missing a `synchronized` statement ( 991b34a44ce69f5fa8df0f84ed8d350b51a5d338 )  \r\n\r\n* Fixed JSON output not being minified for TraceViewer ( 4fbecdff26b85b5579f1e8e6cb972ee8e798dfee )."}

These methods are replaced with the equivalent `PerfMark.linkOut()` and `PerfMark.linkIn(Link)` methods, which fit better with other API methods.   \r\n* Tags passed in to tracing calls are not checked for `null` until much later.  Passing `null` was not allowed, but checking for it add unnecessary overhead when PerfMark was disabled.  Users should continue to avoid passing null.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n* A `TraceEventViewer` class has been added, which aids in the generation of the trace UI.   Users can now call `TraceEventViewer.writeTraceHtml()` to render the trace data, instead of having to pass the JSON to  [`catapult`](https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult).   Note:  this is not yet API stable, as the catapult trace viewer may not be maintained in the future."}
