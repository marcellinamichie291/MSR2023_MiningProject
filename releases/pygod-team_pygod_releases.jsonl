To tailor this need, we just open-sourced the first comprehensive graph outlier detection library--PyGOD.\r\n\r\nPyGOD contains more than 10 latest graph outlier detectors, which are built on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [PyG](https://www.pyg.org). It features: \r\n - unified and simple API as [PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod): using GNNs for outlier detection within 5 lines of code\r\n - full documentation and examples\r\n - for both academic use and industry app, all you need to prepare is the data in PyG format.\r\n\r\nPyGOD is a collaborative effort among UIC, CMU, ASU, IIT, and BUAA. We commit to providing long-term maintenance and keep adding new models to the library. It is also our goal to promote graph outlier detection methods to broader audiences. If you encounter a bug or have any suggestions please [fill an issue](https://github.com/pygod-team/pygod/issues) or reach us via email <dev@pygod.org>. Also, feel free to try it out with your code!\r\n\r\nWe appreciate every star, fork, and follow.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pygod-team/pygod/releases/63568751/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}
