The new `Bobcat` parser has better performance, simplifies installation, and provides compatibility with Windows (which was not supported due to a depccg conflict). depccg is still supported as an alternative external dependency.\r\n- A `training` package, providing a selection of trainers, models, and optimizers that greatly simplify supervised training for most of `lambeq`'s use cases, classical and quantum. The new package adds several new features to `lambeq`, such as the ability to save to and restore models from checkpoints.\r\n- Furthermore, the `training` package uses `DisCoPy`'s tensor network capability to contract tensor diagrams efficiently. In particular, `DisCoPy` 0.4.1's new unitary and density matrix simulators in result in substantially faster training speeds compared to the previous version.\r\n- A command-line interface, which provides most of `lambeq`'s functionality from the command line. For example, `lambeq` can now be used as a standard command-line pregroup parser.\r\n- A web parser class that can send parsing queries to an online API, so that local installation of a parser is not strictly necessary anymore. The web parser is particularly helpful for testing purposes, interactive usage or when a local parser is unavailable, but should not be used for serious experiments.\r\n- A new `lambeq.pregroups` package that provides methods for easy creation of pregroup diagrams, removal of cups, and printing of diagrams in text form (i.e. in a terminal).\r\n- A new `TreeReader` class that exploits the biclosed structure of CCG grammatical derivations.\r\n- Three new rewrite rules for relative pronouns and coordination.\r\n- Tokenisation features have been added in all parsers and readers.\r\n- Additional generator methods and minor improvements for the `CCGBankParser` class.\r\n\r\n**Changed:**\r\n- Improved and more detailed package structure.\r\n- Most classes and functions can now be imported from `lambeq` directly, instead of having to import from the sub-packages.\r\n- The `circuit` and `tensor` modules have been combined into an `lambeq.ansatz` package. (However, as mentioned above, the classes and functions they define can now be imported directly from `lambeq` and should continue to do so in future releases.)\r\n- Improved documentation and additional tutorials."}
