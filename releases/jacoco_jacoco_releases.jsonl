Idea and implementation by Lukas Krejc (GitHub #658).\r\n\r\n## Fixed Bugs\r\n\r\n* Don't insert stackmap frames into class files with version < 1.6, this fixes regression which was introduced in version 0.6.5 (GitHub #667).\r\n* Question mark in filter expressions now correctly matches exactly one character (GitHub #672).\r\n* Part of bytecode that javac generates for `switch` statement on `java.lang.String` values with a small number cases is now correctly filtered out during generation of report (GitHub #730).\r\n\r\n## Non-functional Changes\r\n\r\n* JaCoCo now depends on ASM 6.2.1 (GitHub #706, #725).\r\n* Improved error message when already instrumented classes are used for instrumentation or analysis (GitHub #703).\r\n* JaCoCo build now requires at least Maven 3.3.9 and JDK 8 (GitHub #711).\r\nAPI Changes\r\n* The XML report now has an optional attribute `sourcefilename` on the `class` element to allow unambiguously relate classes to source files. The JaCoCo DTD version has been updated to 1.1 (GitHub #702).\r\n\r\n[All Resolved Issues](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.8.2)"}
