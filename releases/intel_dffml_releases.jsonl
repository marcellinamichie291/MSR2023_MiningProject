A lot has changed in the world of DFFML. Looking back it\u2019s clear how much progress we\u2019ve made. The work that was done to get us to 0.4.0 has really polished the project. There are no doubt still kinks to work out, but we\u2019ve come a long way.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re new to DFFML. See the [Installation](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/installation.html) and [Quickstart](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/quickstart/model.html) documents to get started, then come back here to try out the new features.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\nWe have a ton of cool new features in this release. You can see the CHANGELOG for the full details. We\u2019ll cover some highlights here.\r\n\r\n[Custom Neural Networks](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/tutorials/neuralnetwork.html)\r\n\r\nSaksham, one of our GSoC 2020 students, implemented PyTorch based models. The generic model allows users to use JSON or YAML files to define the layers they want in a neural network.\r\n\r\n[Image classification](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/examples/flower17/flower17.html)\r\n\r\nSaksham also exposed some PyTorch pre-trained models which are very useful for working with images. The full list can be found under [dffml-model-pytorch](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/plugins/dffml_model.html#plugin-model-dffml-model-pytorch) on the model plugins page.\r\n\r\n[Natural Language Processing (NLP) Models and Operations](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/tutorials/dataflows/nlp.html)\r\n\r\nHimanshu, one of our GSoC 2020 students, implemented Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and operations. The Spacy based models can be found under [dffml-model-spacy](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/plugins/dffml_model.html#plugin-model-dffml-model-spacy) on the model plugins page. The operations can be found under [dffml-operations-nlp](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/plugins/dffml_operation.html#plugin-operation-dffml-operations-nlp) on the operations plugins page. We had a slight hangup with the release of the Transformers based models, we hope to send all those out you all as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n[Continuous Deployment Examples](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/examples/webhook/index.html)\r\n\r\nAghin, one of our GSoC 2020 students, wrote operations and tutorials which allow users to receive web hooks from GitHub and re-deploy their containerized models and operations whenever their code is updated.\r\n\r\n[New Models](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/plugins/dffml_model.html)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above mentioned models, we have many more that were added. We now have over 115 models! Check out the model plugins page to see them all.\r\n\r\n[Documentation Testing with Sphinx consoletest extension](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/contributing/consoletest.html)\r\n\r\nWe developed a Sphinx extension which has allowed us to test the code-block:: console directives and others in our documentation. This serves as integration testing / documentation validation. The [Documenting a Model](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/tutorials/models/docs.html) tutorial was written to explain how this can be used to write documentation for your models in the models\u2019 docstrings.\r\n\r\n## Road to Beta\r\n\r\nThings are looking up with regards to the path to our beta release.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re going to start deciding what APIs are stable come the 0.5.0 beta release.\r\n\r\nUp until then, including now, things have been subject to change at any time as we have learned more about our problem space and how best to architecturally approach it.\r\n\r\nWe have several major things on deck that we want to get before we declare beta.\r\n\r\n### AutoML\r\n\r\nWe now have a lot of models to choose from and are at the stage where we need models to help us choose our models! We\u2019re going to have AutoML in the Beta release. This will pick the best model with the best hyper parameters for the job.\r\n\r\n### Accuracy Scorers\r\n\r\nSudhanshu has been working on this since June 2020. He\u2019s done a major refactor of the codebase to take the accuracy methods out of all the models and move them into .score() methods in a new AccuracyScorer method. This will allow users to more easily compare accuracy of models against each other.\r\n\r\n### Machine Learning support for videos\r\n\r\nWe still need to decide how we\u2019re going to support videos. DFFML\u2019s asynchronous approach will hopefully make it convenient to use with live video streams.\r\n\r\n### Model directories auto stored into archives or remotely\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re going to implement automatic packing and unpacking of directories which models get saved and loaded from into/out of archives, such as Zip, Tar, etc. We\u2019ll also implement plugins to be able to push and pull them from remote storage. This will make models convenient to train in one location and deploy another.\r\n\r\n### Remote execution\r\n\r\nThe [HTTP service](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/plugins/service/http/index.html) already allows users to access all the DFFML command line and Python APIs over HTTP. We are going to integrate the [High_Level](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/api/high_level/index.html) API with the HTTP service. A remote execution plugin type will allow users to install only the base package, and whatever remote execution plugin they want on a machine. Users will then be able to run the HTTP service on a machine with all needed ML packages installed, and their Python API calls will run on the HTTP service. In cases where you have multiple architectures, one of which doesn\u2019t have ML packages compiled for it, this will be helpful (Edge).\r\n\r\n### Config files in place of command line parameters\r\n\r\nTo stop users from having to copy paste so many command line parameters across command invocations, we\u2019ll be implementing support for config files. YAML, JSON, etc. will all be able to be used to store what could also be command line arguments.\r\n\r\n### Command line to config file to Python API to HTTP API auto translation\r\n\r\nSince DFFML offers consistent APIs across it\u2019s various interfaces, we will be able to implement an auto translator to convert one API to another. This means that if you have a DFFML command line invocation that you want to make into a Python API call, the translator will take your CLI command and output the DFFML Python API calls in Python.\r\n\r\n### DataFlows with operation implementations in multiple languages\r\n\r\nOur first target is to integrate wasmer to help us run web assembly binaries. We\u2019ll later expand this out to having multiple Operation Implementation networks that will allow users to create DataFlows that run code written in multiple languages. For example, Python, Rust, and Golang. This will allow users to leverage their favorite libraries to get the job done without worrying about them being in different languages.\r\n\r\n### Premade data cleanup DataFlows\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll have a set of out of the box data cleanup DataFlows that users can use before passing data to models. These will do common data cleanup tasks such as removing horrendous outliers.\r\n\r\n### Continuous deployment tutorials\r\n\r\nWe will expand the tutorials released with 0.4.0 to include deployment behind reverse proxies for multiple projects, including how to setup encryption and authentication in a painless and maintainable way.\r\n\r\n### Pandas DataFrame source\r\n\r\nThis is a small convenience that will probably improve usability. This change will allow us to pass DataFrame objects to the train/accuracy/predict functions.\r\n\r\n## Collaborations\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re exploring participation with the OpenSSF Identifying Security Threats working group. Their effort is similar to [shouldi](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/shouldi.html) and we might be able to contribute some of what we\u2019ve done there.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re exploring another use of DFFML internally at Intel. This time leveraging DataFlows more so than Machine Learning.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nSince 0.3.7 we\u2019ve seen 35203/10423 insertions(+)/deletions(-) lines changed, added, or removed, across 757 files.\r\n\r\nYou all have done amazing stuff!!
