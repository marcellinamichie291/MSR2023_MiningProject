In 3.0.0, the `xxxStart` expressions were not really treated like expressions in their own right, but as modifiers to the following expression when used like `LineStart() + expr`, so that if there were whitespace on the line before `expr` (which would match in versions prior to 3.0.0), the match would fail.\r\n\r\n  3.0.0 implemented this by automatically promoting `LineStart() + expr` to `AtLineStart(expr)`, which broke existing parsers that did not expect `expr` to necessarily be right at the start of the line, but only be the first token found on the line. This was reported as a regression in Issue #317.\r\n\r\n  In 3.0.2, pyparsing reverts to the previous behavior, but will retain the new `AtLineStart` and `AtStringStart` expression classes, so that parsers can chose whichever behavior applies in their specific instance. Specifically:\r\n\r\n      # matches expr if it is the first token on the line (allows for leading whitespace)\r\n      LineStart() + expr\r\n\r\n      # matches only if expr is found in column 1\r\n      AtLineStart(expr)\r\n\r\n- Performance enhancement to `one_of` to always generate an internal `Regex`, even if `caseless` or `as_keyword` args are given as `True` (unless explicitly disabled by passing `use_regex=False`).\r\n\r\n- `IndentedBlock` class now works with `recursive` flag. By default, the results parsed by an `IndentedBlock` are grouped. This can be disabled by constructing the `IndentedBlock` with `grouped=False`."}

`pyparsing.enable_diag()`\r\n  - `pyparsing.disable_diag()`\r\n  - `pyparsing.enable_all_warnings()`\r\n\r\n- API CHANGE\r\n  Most previous `SyntaxWarnings` that were warned when using pyparsing classes incorrectly have been converted to `TypeError` and `ValueError` exceptions, consistent with Python calling conventions. All warnings warned by diagnostic flags have been converted from `SyntaxWarnings` to `UserWarnings`.\r\n\r\n- To support parsers that are intended to generate native Python collection types such as lists and dicts, the `Group` and `Dict` classes now accept an additional boolean keyword argument `aslist` and `asdict` respectively. See the `jsonParser.py` example in the `pyparsing/examples` source directory for how to return types as `ParseResults` and as Python collection types, and the distinctions in working with the different types.\r\n\r\n  In addition parse actions that must return a value of list type (which would normally be converted internally to a ParseResults) can override this default behavior by returning their list wrapped in the new `ParseResults.List` class:\r\n\r\n      # this parse action tries to return a list, but pyparsing\r\n      # will convert to a ParseResults\r\n      def return_as_list_but_still_get_parse_results(tokens):\r\n          return tokens.asList()\r\n\r\n      # this parse action returns the tokens as a list, and pyparsing will\r\n      # maintain its list type in the final parsing results\r\n      def return_as_list(tokens):\r\n          return ParseResults.List(tokens.asList())\r\n\r\n  This is the mechanism used internally by the `Group` class when defined using `aslist=True`.\r\n\r\n- A new `IndentedBlock` class is introduced, to eventually replace the current `indentedBlock` helper method. The interface is largely the same,  however, the new class manages its own internal indentation stack, so it is no longer necessary to maintain an external `indentStack` variable.\r\n\r\n- API CHANGE\r\n  Added `cache_hit` keyword argument to debug actions. Previously, if packrat parsing was enabled, the debug methods were not called in the event of cache hits. Now these methods will be called, with an added argument `cache_hit=True`.\r\n\r\n  If you are using packrat parsing and enable debug on expressions using a custom debug method, you can add the `cache_hit=False` keyword argument,\r\n  and your method will be called on packrat cache hits. If you choose not to add this keyword argument, the debug methods will fail silently, behaving as they did previously.\r\n\r\n- When using `setDebug` with packrat parsing enabled, packrat cache hits will now be included in the output, shown with a leading '*'. (Previously, cache hits and responses were not included in debug output.) For those using custom debug actions, see the previous item regarding an optional API change for those methods.\r\n\r\n- `setDebug` output will also show more details about what expression is about to be parsed (the current line of text being parsed, and the current parse position):\r\n\r\n        Match integer at loc 0(1,1)\r\n          1 2 3\r\n          ^\r\n        Matched integer -> ['1']\r\n\r\n  The current debug location will also be indicated after whitespace has been skipped (was previously inconsistent, reported in Issue #244, by Frank Goyens, thanks!).\r\n\r\n- Modified the repr() output for `ParseResults` to include the class name as part of the output. This is to clarify for new pyparsing users who misread the repr output as a tuple of a list and a dict. pyparsing results will now read like:\r\n\r\n      ParseResults(['abc', 'def'], {'qty': 100}]\r\n\r\n  instead of just:\r\n\r\n      (['abc', 'def'], {'qty': 100}]\r\n\r\n- Fixed bugs in Each when passed OneOrMore or ZeroOrMore expressions:\r\n  . first expression match could be enclosed in an extra nesting level\r\n  . out-of-order expressions now handled correctly if mixed with required expressions\r\n  . results names are maintained correctly for these expressions\r\n\r\n- Fixed traceback trimming, and added `ParserElement.verbose_traceback` save/restore to `reset_pyparsing_context()`.\r\n\r\n- Default string for `Word` expressions now also include indications of `min` and `max` length specification, if applicable, similar to regex length specifications:\r\n\r\n        Word(alphas)             -> \"W:(A-Za-z)\"\r\n        Word(nums)               -> \"W:(0-9)\"\r\n        Word(nums, exact=3)      -> \"W:(0-9){3}\"\r\n        Word(nums, min=2)        -> \"W:(0-9){2,...}\"\r\n        Word(nums, max=3)        -> \"W:(0-9){1,3}\"\r\n        Word(nums, min=2, max=3) -> \"W:(0-9){2,3}\"\r\n\r\n  For expressions of the `Char` class (similar to `Word(..., exact=1)`, the expression is simply the character range in parentheses:\r\n\r\n        Char(nums)               -> \"(0-9)\"\r\n        Char(alphas)             -> \"(A-Za-z)\"\r\n\r\n- Removed `copy()` override in `Keyword` class which did not preserve definition of ident chars from the original expression. PR #233 submitted by jgrey4296, thanks!\r\n\r\n- In addition to `pyparsing.__version__`, there is now also a `pyparsing.__version_info__`, following the same structure and field names as in `sys.version_info`.\r\n"}

June, 2020\r\n----------------------------\r\n- Summary of changes for 3.0.0 can be found in \"What's New in Pyparsing 3.0.0\" documentation.\r\n\r\n- API CHANGE\r\n  Changed result returned when parsing using countedArray, the array items are no longer returned in a doubly-nested list.\r\n\r\n- An excellent new enhancement is the new railroad diagram generator for documenting pyparsing parsers:\r\n\r\n        import pyparsing as pp\r\n        from pyparsing.diagram import to_railroad, railroad_to_html\r\n        from pathlib import Path\r\n\r\n        # define a simple grammar for parsing street addresses such\r\n        # as \"123 Main Street\"\r\n        #     number word...\r\n        number = pp.Word(pp.nums).setName(\"number\")\r\n        name = pp.Word(pp.alphas).setName(\"word\")[1, ...]\r\n\r\n        parser = number(\"house_number\") + name(\"street\")\r\n        parser.setName(\"street address\")\r\n\r\n        # construct railroad track diagram for this parser and\r\n        # save as HTML\r\n        rr = to_railroad(parser)\r\n        Path('parser_rr_diag.html').write_text(railroad_to_html(rr))\r\n\r\n  Very nice work provided by Michael Milton, thanks a ton!\r\n\r\n- Enhanced default strings created for Word expressions, now showing string ranges if possible. `Word(alphas)` would formerly print as `W:(ABCD...)`, now prints as `W:(A-Za-z)`.\r\n\r\n- Added ignoreWhitespace(recurse:bool = True) and added a recurse argument to leaveWhitespace, both added to provide finer control over pyparsing's whitespace skipping. Also contributed by Michael Milton.\r\n\r\n- The unicode range definitions for the various languages were recalculated by interrogating the unicodedata module by character name, selecting characters that contained that language in their Unicode name. (Issue #227)\r\n\r\n  Also, pyparsing_unicode.Korean was renamed to Hangul (Korean is also defined as a synonym for compatibility).\r\n\r\n- Enhanced ParseResults dump() to show both results names and list subitems. Fixes bug where adding a results name would hide lower-level structures in the ParseResults.\r\n\r\n- Added new `__diag__` warnings:\r\n\r\n    \"warn_on_parse_using_empty_Forward\" - warns that a Forward has been included in a grammar, but no expression was attached to it using '<<=' or '<<'\r\n\r\n    \"warn_on_assignment_to_Forward\" - warns that a Forward has been created, but was probably later overwritten by erroneously using '=' instead of '<<=' (this is a common mistake when using Forwards) (**currently not working on PyPy**)\r\n\r\n- Added ParserElement.recurse() method to make it simpler for grammar utilities to navigate through the tree of expressions in a pyparsing grammar.\r\n\r\n- Fixed bug in ParseResults repr() which showed all matching entries for a results name, even if listAllMatches was set to False when creating the ParseResults originally. Reported by Nicholas42 on GitHub, good catch! (Issue #205)\r\n\r\n- Modified refactored modules to use relative imports, as pointed out by setuptools project member jaraco, thank you!\r\n\r\n- Off-by-one bug found in the roman_numerals.py example, a bug that has been there for about 14 years! PR submitted by Jay Pedersen, nice catch!\r\n\r\n- A simplified Lua parser has been added to the examples (lua_parser.py).\r\n\r\n- Added make_diagram.py to the examples directory to demonstrate creation of railroad diagrams for selected pyparsing examples. Also restructured some examples to make their parsers importable without running their embedded tests.\r\n"}

To use these diagnostics, set\r\n  them to True after importing pyparsing.\r\n\r\n  Example:\r\n\r\n      import pyparsing as pp\r\n      pp.__diag__.warn_multiple_tokens_in_named_alternation = True\r\n\r\n- Fixed bug introduced by the use of __getitem__ for repetition,\r\n  overlooking Python's legacy implementation of iteration\r\n  by sequentially calling __getitem__ with increasing numbers until\r\n  getting an IndexError. Found during investigation of problem\r\n  reported by murlock, merci!\r\n"}

`expr[...]` is equivalent to `OneOrMore(expr)`\r\n     - `expr[0, ...]` is equivalent to `ZeroOrMore(expr)`\r\n     - `expr[1, ...]` is equivalent to `OneOrMore(expr)`\r\n     - `expr[n, ...]` or `expr[n,]` is equivalent  to `expr*n + ZeroOrMore(expr)` (read as \"n or more instances of expr\")\r\n     - `expr[..., n]` is equivalent to `expr*(0, n)`\r\n     - `expr[m, n]` is equivalent to `expr*(m, n)`\r\n  Note that `expr[..., n]` and `expr[m, n]` do not raise an exception if more than n exprs exist in the input stream.  If this behavior is desired, then write `expr[..., n] + ~expr`.\r\n\r\n- `...` can also be used as short hand for `SkipTo` when used in adding parse expressions to compose an `And` expression.\r\n\r\n      Literal('start') + ... + Literal('end')\r\n      And(['start', ..., 'end'])\r\n\r\n  are both equivalent to:\r\n\r\n      Literal('start') + SkipTo('end')(\"_skipped*\") + Literal('end')\r\n\r\n  The `...` form has the added benefit of not requiring repeating the skip target expression. Note that the skipped text is returned with '_skipped' as a results name, and that the contents of `_skipped` will contain a list of text from all ``...``s in the expression.\r\n\r\n- `...` can also be used as a \"skip forward in case of error\" expression:\r\n\r\n        expr = \"start\" + (Word(nums).setName(\"int\") | ...) + \"end\"\r\n\r\n        expr.parseString(\"start 456 end\")\r\n        ['start', '456', 'end']\r\n\r\n        expr.parseString(\"start 456 foo 789 end\")\r\n        ['start', '456', 'foo 789 ', 'end']\r\n        - _skipped: ['foo 789 ']\r\n\r\n        expr.parseString(\"start foo end\")\r\n        ['start', 'foo ', 'end']\r\n        - _skipped: ['foo ']\r\n\r\n        expr.parseString(\"start end\")\r\n        ['start', '', 'end']\r\n        - _skipped: ['missing <int>']\r\n\r\n  Note that in all the error cases, the `'_skipped'` results name is present, showing a list of the extra or missing items.\r\n\r\n  This form is only valid when used with the `'|'` operator.\r\n\r\n- Improved exception messages to show what was actually found, not just what was expected.\r\n\r\n        word = pp.Word(pp.alphas)\r\n        pp.OneOrMore(word).parseString(\"aaa bbb 123\", parseAll=True)\r\n\r\n  Former exception message:\r\n\r\n        pyparsing.ParseException: Expected end of text (at char 8), (line:1, col:9)\r\n\r\n  New exception message:\r\n\r\n        pyparsing.ParseException: Expected end of text, found '1' (at char 8), (line:1, col:9)\r\n\r\n- Added diagnostic switches to help detect and warn about common parser construction mistakes, or enable additional parse debugging. Switches are attached to the `pyparsing.__diag__` namespace object:\r\n     - `warn_multiple_tokens_in_named_alternation` - flag to enable warnings when a results name is defined on a `MatchFirst` or `Or` expression with one or more `And` subexpressions (default=True)\r\n     - `warn_ungrouped_named_tokens_in_collection` - flag to enable warnings when a results name is defined on a containing expression with ungrouped subexpressions that also have results names (default=True)\r\n     - `warn_name_set_on_empty_Forward` - flag to enable warnings whan a Forward is defined with a results name, but has no contents defined (default=False)\r\n     - `warn_on_multiple_string_args_to_oneof` - flag to enable warnings whan `oneOf` is incorrectly called with multiple str arguments (default=True)\r\n     - `enable_debug_on_named_expressions` - flag to auto-enable debug on all subsequent calls to `ParserElement.setName()` (default=False)\r\n\r\n  `warn_multiple_tokens_in_named_alternation` is intended to help those who currently have set `__compat__.collect_all_And_tokens` to False as a workaround for using the pre-2.3.1 code with named `MatchFirst` or `Or` expressions containing an `And` expression.\r\n\r\n- Added `ParseResults.from_dict` classmethod, to simplify creation of a `ParseResults` with results names using a dict, which may be nested. This makes it easy to add a sub-level of named items to the parsed tokens in a parse action.\r\n\r\n- Added `asKeyword` argument (default=False) to `oneOf`, to force keyword-style matching on the generated expressions.\r\n\r\n- `ParserElement.runTests` now accepts an optional 'file' argument to redirect test output to a file-like object (such as a StringIO, or opened file). Default is to write to sys.stdout.\r\n\r\n- `conditionAsParseAction` is a helper method for constructing a parse action method from a predicate function that simply returns a boolean result. Useful for those places where a predicate cannot be added using `addCondition`, but must be converted to a parse action (such as in `infixNotation`). May be used as a decorator if default message and exception types can be used. See `ParserElement.addCondition` for more details about the expected signature and behavior for predicate condition methods.\r\n\r\n- While investigating issue #93, I found that `Or` and `addCondition` could interact to select an alternative that is not the longest match. This is because `Or` first checks all alternatives for matches without running attached parse actions or conditions, orders by longest match, and then rechecks for matches with conditions and parse actions. Some expressions, when checking with conditions, may end up matching on a shorter token list than originally matched, but would be selected because of its original priority. This matching code has been expanded to do more extensive searching for matches when a second-pass check matches a smaller list than in the first pass.\r\n\r\n- Fixed issue #87, a regression in indented block. Reported by Renz Bagaporo, who submitted a very nice repro example, which makes the bug-fixing process a lot easier, thanks!\r\n\r\n- Fixed MemoryError issue #85 and #91 with str generation for Forwards. Thanks decalage2 and Harmon758 for your patience.\r\n\r\n- Modified `setParseAction` to accept `None` as an argument, indicating that all previously-defined parse actions for the expression should be cleared.\r\n\r\n- Modified `pyparsing_common.real` and `sci_real` to parse reals without leading integer digits before the decimal point, consistent with Python real number formats. Original PR #98 submitted by ansobolev.\r\n\r\n- Modified `runTests` to call `postParse` function before dumping out the parsed results - allows for `postParse` to add further results, such as indications of additional validation success/failure.\r\n\r\n- Updated `statemachine` example: refactored state transitions to use overridden classmethods; added `<statename>Mixin` class to simplify definition of application classes that \"own\" the state object and delegate to it to model state-specific properties and behavior.\r\n\r\n- Added example `nested_markup.py`, showing a simple wiki markup with nested markup directives, and illustrating the use of `...` for skipping over input to match the next expression. (This example uses syntax that is not valid under Python 2.)\r\n\r\n- Rewrote `delta_time.py` example (renamed from `deltaTime.py`) to fix some omitted formats and upgrade to latest pyparsing idioms, beginning with writing an actual BNF.\r\n\r\n- With the help and encouragement from several contributors, including Matej Cepl and Cengiz Kaygusuz, I've started cleaning up the internal coding styles in core pyparsing, bringing it up to modern coding practices from pyparsing's early development days dating back to 2003. Whitespace has been largely standardized along PEP8 guidelines, removing extra spaces around parentheses, and adding them around arithmetic operators and after colons and commas. I was going to hold off on doing this work until after 2.4.1, but after cleaning up a few trial classes, the difference was so significant that I continued on to the rest of the core code base. This should facilitate future work and submitted PRs, allowing them to focus on substantive code changes, and not get sidetracked by whitespace issues.\r\n\r\n- NOTE: Deprecated functions and features that will be dropped in pyparsing 2.5.0 (planned next release):\r\n\r\n  - support for Python 2 - ongoing users running with Python 2 can continue to use pyparsing 2.4.1\r\n\r\n  - `ParseResults.asXML()` - if used for debugging, switch to using `ParseResults.dump()`; if used for data transfer, use `ParseResults.asDict()` to convert to a nested Python dict, which can then be converted to XML or JSON or other transfer format\r\n\r\n  - `operatorPrecedence` synonym for `infixNotation` - convert to calling `infixNotation`\r\n\r\n  - `commaSeparatedList` - convert to using `pyparsing_common.comma_separated_list`\r\n\r\n  - `upcaseTokens` and `downcaseTokens` - convert to using `pyparsing_common.upcaseTokens` and `downcaseTokens`\r\n\r\n  - `__compat__.collect_all_And_tokens` will not be settable to False to revert to pre-2.3.1 results name behavior - review use of names for `MatchFirst` and `Or` expressions containing `And` expressions, as they will return the complete list of parsed tokens, not just the first one. Use `__diag__.warn_multiple_tokens_in_named_alternation` to help identify those expressions in your parsers that will have changed as a result.\r\n"}

Bumps the current version number to 2.4.0, to reflect this incompatible change.\r\n  . Adds a `pyparsing.__compat__` object for specifying compatibility with future breaking changes.\r\n  . Conditionalizes the API-breaking behavior, based on the value `pyparsing.__compat__.collect_all_And_tokens`.  By default, this value will be set to True, reflecting the new bugfixed behavior. To set this value to False, add to your code:\r\n\r\n        import pyparsing\r\n        pyparsing.__compat__.collect_all_And_tokens = False\r\n\r\n  . User code that is dependent on the pre-bugfix behavior can restore it by setting this value to False.\r\n\r\n  In 2.5 and later versions, the conditional code will be removed and setting the flag to True or False in these later versions will have no effect.\r\n\r\n- Updated unitTests.py and simple_unit_tests.py to be compatible with `python setup.py test`. To run tests using setup, do:\r\n\r\n      python setup.py test\r\n      python setup.py test -s unitTests.suite\r\n      python setup.py test -s simple_unit_tests.suite\r\n\r\n  Prompted by issue #83 and PR submitted by bdragon28, thanks.\r\n\r\n- Fixed bug in `ParserElement.runTests` handling '\\n' literals in quoted strings.\r\n\r\n- Added `tag_body` attribute to the start tag expressions generated by `makeHTMLTags`, so that you can avoid using `SkipTo` to roll your own tag body expression:\r\n\r\n      a, aEnd = pp.makeHTMLTags('a')\r\n      link = a + a.tag_body(\"displayed_text\") + aEnd\r\n      for t in s.searchString(html_page):\r\n          print(t.displayed_text, '->', t.startA.href)\r\n\r\n- `indentedBlock` failure handling was improved; PR submitted by TMiguelT, thanks!\r\n\r\n- Address Py2 incompatibility in `simple_unit_tests`, plus explain() and Forward str() cleanup; PRs graciously provided by eswald.\r\n\r\n- Fixed docstring with embedded '\\w', which creates SyntaxWarnings in Py3.8, issue #80.\r\n\r\n- Examples:\r\n\r\n  - Added example parser for rosettacode.org tutorial compiler.\r\n\r\n  - Added example to show how an HTML table can be parsed into a collection of Python lists or dicts, one per row.\r\n\r\n  - Updated SimpleSQL.py example to handle nested selects, reworked 'where' expression to use infixNotation.\r\n\r\n  - Added include_preprocessor.py, similar to macroExpander.py.\r\n\r\n  - Examples using makeHTMLTags use new tag_body expression when retrieving a tag's body text.\r\n\r\n  - Updated examples that are runnable as unit tests:\r\n\r\n        python setup.py test -s examples.antlr_grammar_tests\r\n        python setup.py test -s examples.test_bibparse\r\n\r\n"}

SUPPORT FOR UNICODE CHARACTER RANGES\r\n  This release introduces the pyparsing_unicode namespace class, defining\r\n  a series of language character sets to simplify the definition of alphas,\r\n  nums, alphanums, and printables in the following language sets:\r\n   . Arabic\r\n   . Chinese\r\n   . Cyrillic\r\n   . Devanagari\r\n   . Greek\r\n   . Hebrew\r\n   . Japanese (including Kanji, Katakana, and Hirigana subsets)\r\n   . Korean\r\n   . Latin1 (includes 7 and 8-bit Latin characters)\r\n   . Thai\r\n   . CJK (combination of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean sets)\r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE API CHANGES:\r\n- `IndexError`s raised in parse actions are now wrapped in `ParseException`s\r\n- `ParseResults` have had several bugfixes which remove erroneous nesting levels\r\nSee the CHANGES file for more details. \r\n\r\nNew classes:\r\n- `PrecededBy` - lookbehind match\r\n- `Char` - single character match (similar to `Word(exact=1)`)\r\n"}

September, 2018\r\n-------------------------------\r\n- Fixed bug in SkipTo, if a SkipTo expression that was skipping to\r\n  an expression that returned a list (such as an And), and the \r\n  SkipTo was saved as a named result, the named result could be \r\n  saved as a ParseResults - should always be saved as a string.\r\n  Issue #28, reported by seron.\r\n\r\n- Added simple_unit_tests.py, as a collection of easy-to-follow unit \r\n  tests for various classes and features of the pyparsing library. \r\n  Primary intent is more to be instructional than actually rigorous \r\n  testing. Complex tests can still be added in the unitTests.py file.\r\n\r\n- New features added to the Regex class:\r\n  - optional asGroupList parameter, returns all the capture groups as\r\n    a list\r\n  - optional asMatch parameter, returns the raw re.match result\r\n  - new sub(repl) method, which adds a parse action calling\r\n    re.sub(pattern, repl, parsed_result). Simplifies creating \r\n    Regex expressions to be used with transformString. Like re.sub,\r\n    repl may be an ordinary string (similar to using pyparsing's \r\n    replaceWith), or may contain references to capture groups by group \r\n    number, or may be a callable that takes an re match group and \r\n    returns a string.\r\n    \r\n    For instance:\r\n\r\n        expr = pp.Regex(r\"([Hh]\\d):\\s*(.*)\").sub(r\"<\\1>\\2</\\1>\")\r\n        expr.transformString(\"h1: This is the title\")\r\n\r\n    will return\r\n\r\n        <h1>This is the title</h1>\r\n\r\n- Fixed omission of LICENSE file in source tarball, also added \r\n  CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md per GitHub community standards.\r\n  Issue #31 \r\n"}
