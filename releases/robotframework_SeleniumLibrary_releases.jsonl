The bug was created when the project was renamed from Selenium2Library to SeleniumLibrary and not properly changing the name in all places. In the Alpha 2 the Firefox profile was not included in the SeleniumLibrary package and this caused the error seen in the #878 \r\n"}

For Python 2 we have dropped 2.6 support in the SeleniumLibrary, but we will support Python 2.7 in the foreseen future. The SeleniumLibrary 3.0.0 alpha 2 has been tested with Python 3.3 and Python 3.6. \r\n\r\n## Project was renamed from Selenium2Library to SeleniumLibrary\r\nBecause Selenium version was updated to version three, the old name was not anymore describing what the library supports. Therefore is was decided to rename the Selenium2Library to SeleniumLibrary.\r\n\r\n## New architecture\r\nThe SeleniumLibrary has new architecture, which relies on the [PythonLibCore](https://github.com/robotframework/PythonLibCore). The old multi inheritance madness is gone and is replaced with cleaner and more separated modules. Also the previous releases used the Static library API from Robot Framework, but the new release uses Dynamic library API.\r\n\r\n## Required Robot Framework version\r\nThe minimum required Robot Framework version  has been increased to 2.8.7 #703 \r\n\r\n## New keyword: Element Should Be Focused\r\nThere is new keyword to check that element has a focus. #851 \r\n\r\n## The Get List Items keyword to return labels or values\r\nThe keyword returns the labels or values in the select list identified by locator. #722 \r\n\r\n## Support for Boolean arguments as strings.\r\nNow the SeleniumLibrary support Boolean arguments also as strings. More details in the #719 and in the [documentation](http://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html) Boolean arguments chapter. \r\n\r\n## Support for class strategy for locators\r\nAll selectors can not use `class` as strategy when selecting element with locator. #673 \r\n\r\n## HTML5 specialized text fields not recognized as text fields\r\nSupport HTML5 specialized text fields where added to several keywords. #546 \r\n\r\n## New keyword Get Log was implemented\r\nThere is not possibility to capture browser logs with Get Log keyword. #574\r\n\r\n## The Get Element Attribute keyword was enhanced to support WebElements as selectors\r\nIn earlier releases the Get Element Attribute keyword did not support WebElements as selectors. Now the keyword has been enhanced and the requested attribute can be given as separate argument. #404\r\n\r\nAlso there has been numerous smaller and bigger fixes since the 1.8.0 release. All the issue fixed in the release can be seen from the [issue tracker](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3Av3.0%20)\r\n"}

introduces a few new keywords and contains an important fix for the latest selenium release. As always, if you find any issues let us know. \n\n## Changes\n- Added an argument called screenshot_root_directory that can be passed into S2L's\n  constructor to specify where to store screenshots.\n- Added new keyword `set screenshot directory` which can be used to set the output\n  of screenshots.\n- Added new keyword `Input Text Into Prompt`\n- Modified `get alert message` to accept a parameter `dismiss` (defaults to `True`) which can be\n  used to prevent closing the alert message and instead will just return the alerts text.\n  Also created new keyword `dismiss alert` to dismiss (default) or confirm the alert without\n  reading the text of the alert. Expect cleanup of alert keywords in the future.\n- Added new keyword Input Text Into Prompt\n- Fixed an error where regular functions were not able to be used as a custom locator\n- Changed all test files to have a '.robot' extension\n\n### Important Fixes\n- Fixed issue that caused tests to fail when selenium > 2.26\n"}
