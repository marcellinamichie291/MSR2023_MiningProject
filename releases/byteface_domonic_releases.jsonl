(well It's now just  pointer to dom.Node as a legacy helper.) . which means dom module is now king and the html module is just a wrapper.\r\n\r\nThis is great for lots of reasons. tag used the be the main class. but as the DOM evolved a wierd multi inheritence thing was starting to happen with overrides for all the init methods to be able to call super on each parent. anyway that's all gone. Now that DOM is mature I figured I could just extend node. Then decided to drop tag altogether. However there's still work to do and this is just the first step on the ladder.\r\n\r\nOn plus side logging will be nicer and it should be more optimal.\r\n\r\nAlso dom now has all the proper tag names for classes and html is just a wrapper around those. which changes how the classes were created before. The destruction of tag allowed for them to be easier created as base classes.\r\n\r\nhowever there is some vestigal non standard methods now on Node as remains of tag. I'd rather hide these away. i.e. the 'content' method and some others. also 'name' instead of tagName is being used.\r\n\r\nBut it should be an improvement and make it easier to dev on. As always moving towards a more standard DOM.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it."}

This DOM is reall really huge. It can often feel like the mandala effect (i've said this before) . So if you want to help just fork and start anywhere. It doesn't belong to me which is why I opened sourced it. And it far too much for 1 person to dev. Tests are really far behind as are docs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
