Skater till now has been an interpretation engine to enable post-hoc model evaluation and interpretation. With this PR Skater starts its journey to support interpretable models.\r\nRule List algorithms are highly popular in the space of Interpretable Models because the trained models are represented as simple decision lists. In the latest release, we enable support for Bayesian Rule Lists(BRL).\r\nThe probabilistic classifier( estimating P(Y=1|X) for each X ) optimizes the posterior of a Bayesian hierarchical model over the pre-mined rules.\r\n\r\n    Usage Example:\r\n    ```\r\n    from skater.core.global_interpretation.interpretable_models.brlc import BRLC\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    from sklearn.datasets.mldata import fetch_mldata\r\n    input_df = fetch_mldata(\"diabetes\")\r\n    ...\r\n    Xtrain, Xtest, ytrain, ytest = train_test_split(input_df, y, test_size=0.20, random_state=0)\r\n\r\n    sbrl_model = BRLC(min_rule_len=1, max_rule_len=10, iterations=10000, n_chains=20, drop_features=True)\r\n    # Train a model, by default discretizer is enabled. So, you wish to exclude features then exclude them using\r\n    # the undiscretize_feature_list parameter\r\n    model = sbrl_model.fit(Xtrain, ytrain, bin_labels=\"default\")\r\n    ```\r\n2.

Based on whether your model is a regressor, classifier that returns labels, or classifier that returns probabilities, scorers will automatically expose various scoring algorithms specific to your model. For instance, in the example above, we could do:\r\n```\r\nmodel.scorers.f1(labels, model(X))\r\nmodel.scorers.cross_entropy(labels, model(X))\r\n```\r\n\r\nif it were a regression, we could do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodel.scorers.mse(labels, model(X))\r\n```\r\n\r\nCalling model.scorers.default(labels, model(X)) or simply model.scorers(labels, model(X)) will execute the default scorer for your model, which are:\r\n\r\nregression: mean absolute error\r\nclassifier (probabilities): cross entropy\r\nclassifier (labels): f1\r\n\r\nLet us know if you'd like more scorers, or even better, feel free to make a PR to add more yourself!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Feature Importance Calculation\r\nThe default method of computing feature importance is done by perturbing each feature, and observing how much those perturbations affect predictions.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of model scoring, we now also provide a method based on observing changes in model scoring functions; the less accurate your model becomes based on perturbing a feature, the more important it is.\r\n\r\nTo enable scoring based feature importance, you must load training labels into your interpretation object, like:\r\n```\r\ninterpreter = Interpretation(training_data=training_data, training_labels=training_labels)\r\ninterpreter.feature_importance.plot_feature_importance(model, method='model-scoring')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explicit Model Types\r\n\r\nOriginall Skater tried to infer the type of your model based on the types of predictions it made. Now when  you create a model, you can define these explicitely with `model_type` and `probability` keyword arguments to skater model types:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodel = InMemoryModel(predict_fn, model_type='classifier', probability=True)\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\nmodel = InMemoryModel(predict_fn, model_type='regressor')\r\n```"}
