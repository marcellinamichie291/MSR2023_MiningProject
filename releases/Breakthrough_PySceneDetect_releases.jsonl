Notes\r\n\r\nPySceneDetect v0.6 is a **major breaking change** including better performance, configuration file support, and a more ergonomic API.  The new **minimum Python version is now 3.6**. See the [Migration Guide](https://manual.scenedetect.com/en/v0.6/api/migration_guide.html) for information on how to port existing applications to the new API.  Most users will see performance improvements after updating, and changes to the command-line are not expected to break most workflows.\r\n\r\nThe main goals of v0.6 are reliability and performance. To achieve this required several breaking changes.  The video input API was refactored, and *many* technical debt items were addressed. This should help the eventual transition to the first planned stable release (v1.0) where the goal is an improved scene detection API.\r\n\r\nBoth the Windows installer and portable distributions now include signed executables. Many thanks to SignPath, AppVeyor, and AdvancedInstaller for their support.\r\n\r\n#### Changelog\r\n\r\n**Overview:**\r\n\r\n * Major performance improvements on multicore systems\r\n * [Configuration file support](http://scenedetect.com/projects/Manual/en/v0.6/cli/config_file.html) via command line option or user settings folder\r\n * Support for multiple video backends, PyAV is now supported in addition to OpenCV\r\n * Breaking API changes to `VideoManager` (replaced with `VideoStream`), `StatsManager`, and `save_images()`\r\n    * See the [Migration Guide](https://manual.scenedetect.com/en/v0.6/api/migration_guide.html) for details on how to update from v0.5.x\r\n    * A backwards compatibility layer has been added to prevent most applications from breaking, will be removed in a future release\r\n * Support for Python 2.7 has been dropped, minimum supported Python version is 3.6\r\n * Support for OpenCV 2.x has been dropped, minimum OpenCV version is 3.x\r\n * Windows binaries are now signed, thanks [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) (certificate by [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/))\r\n\r\n**Command-Line Changes:**\r\n\r\n * Configuration files are now supported, [see documentation for details](http://scenedetect.com/projects/Manual/en/v0.6/cli/config_file.html)\r\n     * Can specify config file path with `-c`/`--config`, or create a `scenedetect.cfg` file in your user config folder\r\n * Frame numbers are now 1-based, aligning with most other tools (e.g. `ffmpeg`) and video editors ([#265](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/265))\r\n * Start/end *frame numbers* of adjacent scenes no longer overlap ([#264](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/265))\r\n     * End/duration timecodes still include the frame's presentation time\r\n * Add `--merge-last-scene` option to merge last scene if shorter than `--min-scene-len`\r\n * Add `-b`/`--backend` option to use a specific video decoding backend\r\n     * Supported backends are `opencv` and `pyav`\r\n     * Run `scenedetect help` to see a list of backends available on the current system\r\n     * Both backends are included with Windows builds\r\n * `split-video` command:\r\n     * `-c`/`--copy` now uses `ffmpeg` instead of `mkvmerge` ([#77](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/77), [#236](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/236))\r\n     * Add `-m`/`--mkvmerge` flag to use `mkvmerge` instead of `ffmpeg` ([#77](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/77))\r\n     * Long name for `-a` has been changed to `--args` (from `--override-args`)\r\n * `detect-adaptive` command:\r\n     * `--drop-short-scenes` now works properly with `detect-adaptive`\r\n * `detect-content` command:\r\n     * Default threshold `-t`/`--threshold` lowered to 27 to be more sensitive to shot changes ([#246](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/246))\r\n     * Add override for global `-m`/`--min-scene-len` option\r\n * `detect-threshold` command:\r\n     * Remove `-p`/`--min-percent` and `-b`/`--block-size` options\r\n     * Add override for global `-m`/`--min-scene-len` option\r\n * `save-images` command now works when `-i`/`--input` is an image sequences\r\n * Default backend (OpenCV) is more robust to video decoder failures\r\n * `-i`/`--input` may no longer be specified multiple times, if required use an external tool (e.g. `ffmpeg`, `mkvmerge`) to perform concatenation before processing\r\n * `-s`/`--stats` no longer loads existing statistics and will overwrite any existing files\r\n * `-l`/`--logfile` now respects `-o`/`--output`\r\n * `-v`/`--verbosity` now takes precedence over `-q`/`--quiet`\r\n\r\n**API Changes:**\r\n\r\n * New `detect()` function performs scene detection on a video path, [see example here](http://manual.scenedetect.com/en/v0.6/api.html#quickstart)\r\n * New `open_video()` function to handle video input, [see example here](http://manual.scenedetect.com/en/v0.6/api.html#example)\r\n * `split_video_ffmpeg()` and `split_video_mkvmerge()` now take a single path as input\r\n * `save_images()` no longer accepts `downscale_factor`\r\n    * Use `scale` or `height`/`width` arguments to resize images\r\n * New `VideoStream` replaces `VideoManager` ([#213](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/213))\r\n    * Supports both OpenCV (`VideoStreamCv2`) and PyAV (`VideoStreamAv`)\r\n    * Improves video seeking invariants, especially around defining what frames 0 and 1 mean for different time properties (`frame_number` is 1-based whereas `position` is 0-based to align with PTS)\r\n    * See `test_time_invariants` in `tests/test_video_stream.py` as a reference of specific behaviours\r\n * Changes to `SceneManager`:\r\n    * `detect_scenes()` now performs video decoding in a background thread, improving performance on most systems\r\n    * `SceneManager` is now responsible for frame downscaling via the `downscale`/`auto_downscale` properties\r\n    * `detect_scenes()` no longer shows a progress bar by default, set `show_progress=True` to restore the previous behaviour\r\n    * `clear()` now clears detectors, as they may be stateful\r\n    * `get_scene_list()` now returns an empty list if there are no detected cuts, specify `start_in_scene=True` for previous behavior (one scene spanning the entire input)\r\n * Changes to `StatsManager`:\r\n    * `save_to_csv()` now accepts a path or an open file handle\r\n    * `base_timecode` argument has been removed from `save_to_csv()`\r\n    * `load_from_csv()` is now deprecated and will be removed in v1.0\r\n * Changes to `FrameTimecode`:\r\n    * Use rounding instead of truncation when calculating frame numbers to fix incorrect round-trip conversions and improve accuracy ([#268](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/268))\r\n    * Fix `previous_frame()` generating negative frame numbers in some cases\r\n    * `FrameTimecode` objects can now perform arithmetic with formatted strings, e.g. `'HH:MM:SS.nnn'`\r\n * Merged constants `MAX_FPS_DELTA` and `MINIMUM_FRAMES_PER_SECOND_DELTA_FLOAT` in `scenedetect.frame_timecode` into new `MAX_FPS_DELTA` constant\r\n * `video_manager` parameter has been removed from the `AdaptiveDetector` constructor\r\n * `split_video_ffmpeg` and `split_video_mkvmerge` function arguments have been renamed and defaults updated:\r\n    * `suppress_output` is now `show_output`, default is `False`\r\n    * `hide_progress` is now `show_progress`, default is `False`\r\n * `block_size` argument has been removed from the `ThresholdDetector` constructor\r\n * `calculate_frame_score` method of `ContentDetector` has been renamed to `_calculate_frame_score`, use new module-level function of the same name instead\r\n * `get_aspect_ratio` has been removed from `scenedetect.platform` (use the `aspect_ratio` property of a `VideoStream` instead)\r\n * Backwards compatibility with v0.5 to avoid breaking most applications on release while still allowing performance improvements\r\n\r\n#### Python Distribution Changes\r\n\r\n * *v0.6.0.3* - Fix missing package description\r\n * *v0.6.0.2* - Improve error messaging when OpenCV is not installed\r\n * *v0.6.0.1* - Fix original v0.6 release requiring `av` to run the `scenedetect` command\r\n \r\n#### Known Issues\r\n\r\n * URL inputs are not supported by the `save-images` or `split-video` commands\r\n * Variable framerate videos (VFR) are not fully supported, and will yield incorrect timestamps ([#168](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/168))\r\n * The `detect-threshold` option `-l`/`--add-last-scene` cannot be disabled\r\n * Due to a switch from EXE to MSI for the Windows installer, you may have to uninstall older versions first before installing v0.6"}

`detect-content`, but with reduced false negatives during fast camera movement (thanks @scarwire and @wjs018)\r\n * Images generated by `save-images` can now be resized via the command line\r\n * Statsfiles now work properly with `detect-threshold`\r\n * Removed the `-p`/`--min-percent` option from `detect-threshold`\r\n * Add new option `-l`/`--luma-only` to `detect-content`/`detect-adaptive` to only consider brightness channel (useful for greyscale videos)\r\n\r\n#### Changelog\r\n\r\n * [feature] New adaptive content detector algorithm `detect-adaptive` ([#153](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/153), thanks @scarwire and @wjs018)\r\n * [feature] Images generated with the `save-images` command (`scene_manager.save_images()` function in the Python API) can now be scaled or resized ([#160](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/160) and [PR #203](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/pull/203), thanks @wjs018)\r\n     * Images can be resized by a constant scaling factory using `-s`/`--scale` (e.g. `--scale 0.5` shrinks the height/width by half)\r\n     * Images can be resized to a specified height (`-h`/`--height`) and/or width (`-w`/`--width`), in pixels; if only one is specified, the aspect ratio of the original video is kept\r\n * [api] Calling `seek()` on a `VideoManager` will now respect the end time if set\r\n * [api] The `split_video_` functions now return the exit code of invoking `ffmpeg` or `mkvmerge` ([#209](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/209), thanks  @AdrienLF)\r\n * [api] Removed the `min_percent` argument from `ThresholdDetector` as was not providing any performance benefit for the majority of use cases ([#178](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/178))\r\n * [bugfix] The `detect-threshold` command now works properly with a statsfile ([#211](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/211), thanks @jeremymeyers)\r\n * [bugfix] Fixed crash due to unhandled `TypeError` exception when using non-PyPI OpenCV packages from certain Linux distributions ([#220](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/220))\r\n * [bugfix] A warning is now displayed for videos which may not be decoded correctly, esp. VP9 ([#86](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/86), thanks @wjs018)\r\n * [api] A named logger is now used for both API and CLI logging instead of the root logger ([#205](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/205))\r\n\r\n#### Known Issues\r\n\r\n * Variable framerate videos (VFR) are not fully supported, and will yield incorrect timestamps ([#168](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/168))\r\n * The `-l`/`--add-last-scene` option in `detect-threshold` cannot be disabled\r\n * Image sequences or URL inputs are not supported by the `save-images` or `split-video` commands (in v0.6 `save-images` works with image sequences)\r\n * Due to the use of truncation for frame number calculation, FrameTimecode objects may be off-by-one when constructed using a float value ([#268](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/268), fixed in v0.6)", "discussion_url": "https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/discussions/232", "mentions_count": 4}

API\r\n * The `--min-scene-len`/`-m` option is now global rather than per-detector\r\n * There is a new global option `--drop-short-scenes` to go along with `-m`\r\n * Removed first row from statsfiles so it is a valid CSV file\r\n * The progress bar now correctly resizes when the terminal is resized\r\n * Image sequences and URLs are now supported for input via the CLI/API\r\n * Images exported using the `save-images` command are now resized to match the display aspect ratio\r\n * A new flag `-s`/`--skip-cuts` has been added to the `list-scenes` command to allow standardized processing\r\n * The functionality of `save-images` is now accessible via the Python API through the `save_images()` function in `scenedetect.scene_manager`\r\n * Under the `save-images` command, renamed `--image-frame-margin` to `--frame-margin`, added short option `-m`, and increased the default value from 0 to 1 due to instances of the last frame of a video being occasionally missed (set `-m 0` to restore original behaviour)\r\n\r\n#### Changelog\r\n\r\nFull changelog can be found [here on Github](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/blob/master/docs/changelog.md#055-january-17-2021-).\r\n\r\n#### Known Issues\r\n\r\n * Image sequences or URL inputs are not supported by the `save-images` or `split-video` commands\r\n * Variable framerate videos (VFR) are not fully supported, and will yield incorrect timestamps ([#168](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/168))"}

Summary of major API changes:\r\n\r\n - Modify definition of end timecode returned by `scenedetect.SceneManager.get_scene_list()` method from `N`, where `N` is the last frame shown in the scene, to `N+1`.  This now means that the end timecode/frame **equals** the start timecode/frame of the next adjacent scene.  Also note that this is also the definition expected from the external tools used to export video when specifying the `split-video` command, improving compatibility with third-party tools.\r\n - If the `frame_skip` option is specified to be greater than 0 when using a `scenedetect.SceneManager`, it is now explicitly **disallowed** to use a `scenedetect.StatsManager` with the `SceneManager`.  If quicker processing speed is required, users should set the `downscale_factor` via `set_downscale_factor(downscale_factor=None)`. If no `downscale_factor` is passed (i.e. `downscale_factor` is `None`), the downscale factor will be computed automatically based on the resolution of the source material, which provides a balance of performance and accuracy for most videos.\r\n - Removed unnecessary `new_time` argument from `FrameTimecode` object, and modify second argument `fps` so it can also be a `FrameTimecode` object from which the framerate is copied, allowing creation of new timecodes from existing ones to follow a much more intuitive syntax.\r\n\r\nSummary of major CLI changes from v0.5-beta:\r\n\r\n - Fix erroneous output given by default `split-video` mode. The new default mode for `split-video` is what `-p/--precise` used to be, but somewhat faster, with an additional `-h/--high-quality` flag to increase output video quality at expense of time, thus the default mode for `split-video` is slower than it used to be, but significantly more accurate in terms of where output videos are split\r\n - The `split-video` flag `-m/--mkvmerge` has been changed to `-c/--copy` to better indicate what is happening, and requires mkvmerge, which produces output files significantly faster, but at the expense of frame-perfect accuracy when splitting.\r\n - Fix erroneous output given by `split-video -c/--copy`.\r\n - Changed `split-video` option `-f/--ffmpeg-args` to `-a/--override-args` to prevent conflicts with new options\r\n - Add`split-video` option `-o/--output DIR` to specify output directory as well as `-f/--filename NAME` to specify output filename, which allows the use of the macros `$VIDEO_NAME` and `$SCENE_NUMBER` in `NAME`\r\n\r\nSeveral updates to other commands as well; use the `help` command to list all available commands, and the `help [command]` command to view the options/flags for a particular command (or alternatively `help all` to show the entire PySceneDetect help/reference manual).  Also fixed setup.py (thanks @ishandutta2007).\r\n"}
