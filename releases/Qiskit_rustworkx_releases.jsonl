Those releases both added custom return types `BFSSuccessors`, `NodeIndices`, `EdgeList`, and `WeightedEdgeList` that implemented the Python sequence protocol which were used in place of lists for certain functions and methods. However, none of those classes had support for being pickled, which was causing compatibility issues for users that were using the return in a context where it would be pickled (for example as an argument to or return of a function called with multiprocessing). This release has a single change over 0.7.0 which is to add the missing support for pickling `BFSSuccessors`, `NodeIndices`, `EdgeList`, and `WeightedEdgeList` which fixes that issue.\r\n"}

If you want to use\r\nretworkx with Python 3.5 that last version which supports Python 3.5\r\nis 0.6.0.\r\n\r\nAdded\r\n-----\r\n- New generator functions for two new generator types, mesh and grid\r\n  were added to `retworkx.generators` for generating all to all and grid\r\n  graphs respectively.  These functions are:\r\n  `retworkx.generators.mesh_graph()`,\r\n  `retworkx.generators.directed_mesh_graph()`,\r\n  `retworkx.generators.grid_graph()`, and\r\n  `retworkx.generators.directed_grid_graph()`\r\n- A new function, `digraph_union()`, for taking the union between two\r\n  `PyDiGraph` objects has been added.\r\n- A new `PyDiGraph` method `merge_nodes()` has been added. This method can be used\r\n  to merge 2 nodes in a graph if they have the same weight/data payload.\r\n- A new `PyDiGraph` method `find_node_by_weight()` which can be used to lookup\r\n  a node index by a given weight/data payload.\r\n- A new return type `NodeIndices` has been added. This class is returned\r\n  by functions and methods that return a list of node indices. It\r\n  implements the Python sequence protocol and can be used as list.\r\n- Two new return types `EdgeList` and `WeightedEdgeList`. These classes are\r\n  returned from functions and methods that return a list of edge tuples\r\n  and a list of edge tuples with weights. They both implement the Python\r\n  sequence protocol and can be used as a list\r\n- A new function `collect_runs()` has been added. This function is used to\r\n  find linear paths of nodes that match a given condition.\r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n-------\r\n- Support for running retworkx on Python 3.5 has been dropped. The last\r\n  release with support for Python 3.5 is 0.6.0.\r\n- The `PyDiGraph.node_indexes()`, `PyDiGraph.neighbors()`,\r\n  `PyDiGraph.successor_indices()`, `PyDiGraph.predecessor_indices()`,\r\n  `PyDiGraph.add_nodes_from()`, `PyGraph.node_indexes()`,\r\n  `PyGraph.add_nodes_from()`, and `PyGraph.neighbors()` methods and the\r\n  `dag_longest_path()`, `topological_sort()`,\r\n  `graph_astar_shortest_path()`, and `digraph_astar_shortest_path()`\r\n  functions now return a `NodeIndices` object instead of a list of\r\n  integers. This should not require any changes unless explicit type\r\n  checking for a list was used.\r\n- The `PyDiGraph.edge_list()` and `PyGraph.edge_list()` methods and\r\n  `digraph_dfs_edges()`, `graph_dfs_edges()`, and `digraph_find_cycle()`\r\n  functions now return an `EdgeList` object instead of a list of integers.\r\n  This should not require any changes unless explicit type checking\r\n  for a list was used.\r\n- The `PyDiGraph.weighted_edge_list()`, `PyDiGraph.in_edges()`,\r\n  `PyDiGraph.out_edges()`, and `PyGraph.weighted_edge_list()` methods now\r\n  return a `WeightedEdgeList` object instead of a list of integers. This\r\n  should not require any changes unless explicit type checking for a\r\n  list was used.\r\n\r\nFixes\r\n-----\r\n- `BFSSuccessors` objects now can be compared with `==` and `!=` to any other\r\n  Python sequence type\r\n- The built and published sdist packages for retworkx were previously\r\n  not including the Cargo.lock file. This meant that the reproducible\r\n  build versions of the rust dependencies were not passed through to\r\n  source. This has been fixed so building from sdist will always use\r\n  known working versions that we use for testing in CI."}

The main focus of this release was to expand the retworkx API functionality to include some commonly needed functions that were missing.\r\n\r\nThis release is also the first release to provide full support for running with Python 3.9. On previous releases Python 3.9 would likely work, but it would require building retworkx from source. Also this will likely be the final release that supports Python 3.5.\r\n\r\nAdded\r\n-----\r\n- Two new functions, `digraph_k_shortest_path()` and `graph_k_shortest_path()`, for finding the k shortest path lengths from a node in a `PyDiGraph` and `PyGraph`.\r\n- A new method, `is_symmetric()`, to the `PyDiGraph` class. This method will check whether the graph is symmetric or not\r\n- A new kwarg, `as_undirected`, was added to the `digraph_floyd_warshall_numpy()` function. This can be used to treat the input `PyDiGraph` object as if it was undirected for the generated output matrix.\r\n- A new function, `digraph_find_cycle()`, which will return the first cycle during a depth first search of a `PyDiGraph` object.\r\n- Two new functions, `directed_gnm_random_graph()` and `undirected_gnm_random_graph()`, for generating random G(n, m) graphs.\r\n- A new method, `remove_edges_from()`, was added to `PyDiGraph` and `PyGraph`. This can be used to remove multiple edges from a graph object in a single call.\r\n- A new method, `subgraph()`, was added to `PyDiGraph` and `PyGraph` which takes in a list of node indices and will return a new object of the same type representing a subgraph containing the node indices in that list.\r\n- Added support for running with Python 3.9\r\n- A new method, `to_undirected(), was added to `PyDiGraph`. This method will generate an undirected `PyGraph` object from the `PyDiGraph` object.\r\n- A new kwarg, `bidirectional`, was added to the directed generator functions `directed_cycle_graph()`, `directed_path_graph()`, and `directed_star_graph()`. When set to `True` the directed graphs generated by these functions will add edges in both directions.\r\n- Added two new functions, `is_weakly_connected()` and `weakly_connected_components()`, which will either check if a `PyDiGraph` object is weakly connected or return the list of the weakly connected components of an input `PyDiGraph`.\r\n- The `weight_fn` kwarg for `graph_adjacency_matrix()`, `digraph_adjacency_matrix()`, `graph_floyd_warshall_numpy()`, and `digraph_floyd_warshall_numpy()` is now optional. Previously it always had to be specified when calling these function. But instead you can now rely on a default weight float (which defaults to 1.0) to be used for all the edges in the graph.\r\n- Add a `neighbors()` method to `PyGraph` and `PyDiGraph`. This function will return the node indices of the neighbor nodes for a given input node.\r\n- Two new methods, `successor_indices()` and `predecessor_indices()`, were added to `PyDiGraph`. These methods will return the node indices for the successor and predecessor nodes of a given input node.\r\n- Two new functions, `graph_distance_matrix()` and `digraph_distance_matrix()`, were added for generating a distance matrix from an input `PyGraph` and `PyDiGraph`.\r\n- Two new functions, `digraph_dijkstra_shortest_paths()` and `graph_dijkstra_shortest_path()`, were added for returning the shortest\r\n  paths from a node in a `PyDiGraph` and a `PyGraph` object.\r\n- Two new methods, `insert_node_on_in_edges()` and `insert_node_on_out_edges()`, were added to `PyDiGraph`. These functions\r\n  are used to insert an existing node in between an reference node and all it's predecessors or successors.\r\n- Two new functions, `graph_dfs_edges()` and `digraph_dfs_edges()`, were added to get an edge list in depth first order from a `PyGraph` and\r\n  `PyDiGraph`.\r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n-------\r\n- The numpy arrays returned by `graph_floyd_warshall_numpy()`, `digraph_floyd_warshall_numpy()`, `digraph_adjacency_matrix()`, and `graph_adjacency_matrix()` will now be in a contiguous C array memory layout. Previously they would return arrays in a column-major fortran layout. This was change was made to make it easier to interface the arrays returned by these functions with other C Python extensions. There should be no change when interacting with the numpy arrays via numpy's API.\r\n- The `bfs_successors()` method now returns an object of a custom type `BFSSuccessors` instead of a list. The `BFSSuccessors` type implements the Python sequence protocol so it can be used in place like a list (except for where explicit type checking is used). This was done to defer the type conversion between Rust and Python since doing it all at once can be a performance bottleneck especially for large graphs. The `BFSSuccessors` class will only do the type conversion when an element is accessed.\r\n\r\nFixes\r\n-----\r\n- When pickling `PyDiGraph` objects the original node indices will be preserved across the pickle.\r\n- The random gnp functions, `directed_gnp_random_graph()` and `undirected_gnp_random_graph()`, will now also handle exact 0 or 1\r\n  probabilities. Previously it would fail in these cases. Fixes #172"}

The main\r\nfocus of the improvements of this release was to increase the ease of\r\ninteracting with graph objects. This includes adding support for generating dot\r\noutput which can be used with graphviz (or similar tools) for visualizing\r\ngraphs adding more methods to query the state of graph, adding a generator\r\nmodule for easily creating graphs of certain shape, and implementing the\r\nmapping protocol so you can directly interact with graph objects.\r\n\r\nAdded\r\n-----\r\n- A new method, `to_dot()`, was added to `PyGraph` and `PyDiGraph`. It will\r\n  generate a dot format representation of the object which can be used\r\n  with Graphivz (or similar tooling) to generate visualizations of the\r\n  graph.\r\n- Added a new function, `strongly_connected_components()`, to get the list\r\n  of strongly connected components of a `PyDiGraph` object.\r\n- A new method, `compose()`, for combing another graph object of the same\r\n  type was added to `PyGraph` and `PyDiGraph`.\r\n- The `PyGraph` and `PyDigraph` classes now implement the Python mapping\r\n  protocol for interacting with graph nodes. You can now access and\r\n  interact with node data directly by using standard map access patterns\r\n  in python. For example, running `graph[1]` will return the data for the\r\n  index at node 1.\r\n- A new module, `retworkx.generators`, has been added. Functions in this\r\n  module can be used for quickly generating graphs of certain shape.\r\n- A new method, `remove_node_retain_edges()`, has been added to the\r\n  `PyDiGraph` class. This method can be used to remove a node and add\r\n  edges from its predecesors to its successors.\r\n- Two new methods, `edge_list()` and `weighted_edge_list()`, for getting a\r\n  list of tuples with the edge source and target (with or without edge\r\n  weights) have been added to `PyGraph` and `PyDigraph`.\r\n- A new function, `cycle_basis()`, for getting a list of cycles which form\r\n  a basis for cycles of a `PyGraph` object.\r\n- Two new functions, `graph_floyd_warshall_numpy()` and\r\n  `digraph_floyd_warshall_numpy()`, were added for running the Floyd Warshall\r\n  algorithm and returning all the shortest path lengths as a distance\r\n  matrix.\r\n- A new constructor method, `read_edge_list()`, has been added to `PyGraph` and\r\n  `PyDigraph`. This method will take in a path to an edge list file and\r\n  will read that file and generate a new object from the contents.\r\n- A new method, `extend_from_edge_list()`, has been added to `PyGraph` and\r\n  `PyDiGraph`. This method takes in an edge list and will add both the edges and\r\n  nodes (if a node index used doesn't exist yet) in the list to the graph.\r\n\r\nFixes\r\n-----\r\n\r\n- The limitation with `is_isomorphic()` and `is_isomorphic_node_match()` functions\r\n  that would cause segfaults when comparing graphs with node removals\r\n  has been fixed. You can now run either function with any\r\n  `PyDiGraph`/`PyDAG` objects, even if there are node removals.

But, the biggest change for this\r\nrelease is that this is the first release of retworkx that supports\r\ncompilation with a stable released version of rust. This was made\r\npossible thanks to all the hard work of the PyO3 maintainers and\r\ncontributors in the PyO3 0.11.0 release.\r\n\r\nAdded\r\n-----\r\n\r\n- A new class for undirected graphs, `PyGraph`, was added.\r\n- 2 new functions `graph_adjacency_matrix()` and\r\n  `digraph_adjacency_matrix()` to get the adjacency matrix of a `PyGraph`\r\n  and` PyDiGraph` object.\r\n- A new `PyDiGraph` method, `find_adjacent_node_by_edge()`, was added. This is\r\n  used to locate an adjacent node given a condition based on the edge between them.\r\n- New methods, `add_nodes_from()`, `add_edges_from()`,\r\n  `add_edges_from_no_data()`, and `remove_nodes_from()` were added to `PyDiGraph`\r\n  (and `PyGraph`). These methods allow for the addition (and removal) of\r\n  multiple nodes or edges from a graph in a single call.\r\n- A new function, `graph_greedy_coloring()`, which is used to return a\r\n  coloring map from a `PyGraph` object.\r\n- 2 new functions, `graph_astar_shortest_path()` and `digraph_astar_shortest_path()`,\r\n  to find the shortest path from a node to a specified goal using the A*\r\n  search algorithm.\r\n- 2 new functions, `graph_all_simple_paths()` and\r\n  `digraph_all_simple_paths()`, to return a list of all the simple paths\r\n  between 2 nodes in a `PyGraph` or `PyDiGraph` object.\r\n- 2 new functions, `directed_gnp_random_graph()` and\r\n  `undirected_gnp_random_graph()`, to generate Gnp random `PyDiGraph` and\r\n  `PyGraph` objects.\r\n- 2 new functions, `graph_dijkstra_shortest_path_lengths()` and\r\n  `digraph_dijkstra_shortest_path_lengths()`, were added for find the shortest paths\r\n  between nodes in `PyGraph` or `PyDiGraph` object using Dijkstra's\r\n  algorithm.\r\n\r\nChanged\r\n-------\r\n\r\n- The `PyDAG` class was renamed `PyDiGraph` to better reflect it's\r\n  functionality. For backwards compatibility `PyDAG` still exists as a python\r\n  subclass of `PyDiGraph`. No changes should be required for existing\r\n  users.\r\n- numpy is now a dependency of retworkx. This is used for the adjacency\r\n  matrix functions to return numpy arrays. The minimum version of numpy\r\n  supported is 1.16.0.\r\n\r\nFixes\r\n-----\r\n\r\n- The retworkx exception classes are now properly exported from the\r\n  retworkx module. In prior releases it was not possible to import the\r\n  exception classes (normally to catch one being raised) requiring users\r\n  to catch the base Exception class. This has been fixed so a\r\n  specialized retworkx exception class can be used."}
