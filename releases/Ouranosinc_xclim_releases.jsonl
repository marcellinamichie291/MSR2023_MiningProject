([GH/1185](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1185), [PR/1209](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1209)).\r\n* Documentation now supports intersphinx mapping references within code examples via `sphinx-codeautolink` and copying of code blocks via `sphinx-copybutton`. ([PR/1182](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1182)).\r\n* Log-logistic distribution added to `stats.py` for use with ``standardized_precipitation_index`` and ``standardized_precipitation_evapotranspiration_index``. ([GH/1141](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1141), [PR/1183](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1183)).\r\n* New option in many indices allowing for resampling in given periods after ``run_length`` operations. ([GH/505](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/505), [GH/916](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/916), [GH/917](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/917), [PR/1161](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1161)).\r\n* New base indicator class for sdba: ``StatisticalPropertyMeasure``, those measures that also reduce the time (as a property does). ([PR/1198](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1198)).\r\n* ``xclim.core.calendar.common_calendar`` to find the best calendar to use when uniformizing an heterogeneous collection of data. ([PR/1217](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1217)).\r\n* ``xclim.ensembles.create_ensemble`` now accepts ``calendar=None``, and uses the above function to guess the best one. It also now accepts ``cal_kwargs`` to fine tune the calendar conversion. ([GH/1190](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1190), [PR/1217](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1217)).\r\n* New data check : ``xclim.core.datachecks.check_common_time`` that ensures all inputs of multivariate indicators have the same frequency (and the same time anchoring for daily and hourly data). ([GH/1111](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1111), [PR/1217](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1217)).\r\n\r\n### New indicators\r\n* New indices ``first_day_temperature_{above | below}`` and indicators ``xclim.indices.first_day_{tn | tg | tx}_{above | below}``. These indices/indicators accept operator (``op``) keyword for finer threshold comparison controls. ([GH/1175](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1175), [PR/1186](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1186)).\r\n* New generic indice ``cumulative_difference`` for calculating difference between values and thresholds across time (e.g. temperature: degree-days, precipitation: moisture deficit), with or without resampling/accumulating by frequency. ([PR/1202](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1202)).\r\n* New spatial sdba properties and measures : ``spatial_correlogram``, ``scorr`` and ``first_eof``. The later needs the optional dependency [eofs](https://ajdawson.github.io/eofs/). ([PR/1198](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1198)).\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* Indices that accept `lat` or `lon` coordinates in their call signatures will now use `cf-xarray` accessors to gather these variables in the event that they are not explicitly supplied. ([PR/1180](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1180)). This affects the following:\r\n    - ``huglin_index``, ``biologically_effective_degree_days``, ``cool_night_index``, ``latitude_temperature_index``, ``water_budget``, ``potential_evapotranspiration``\r\n* ``cool_night_index`` now optionally accepts ``lat: str = \"north\" | \"south\"`` for calculating CNI over DataArrays lacking a latitude coordinate. ([PR/1180](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1180)).\r\n* The offset value in ``standardized_precipitation_evapotranspiration_index`` is changed to better reproduce results in the reference library ``monocongo/climate_indices``. ([GH/1141](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1141), [PR/1183](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1183)).\r\n* The ``first_day_below`` and ``first_day_above`` indices are now deprecated in order to clearly communicate the variables they act upon ([GH/1175](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1175), [PR/1186](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1186)). The suggested migrations are as follows:\r\n    - ``xclim.indices.first_day_above`` -> ``xclim.indices.first_day_temperature_above``\r\n    - ``xclim.indices.first_day_below`` -> ``xclim.indices.first_day_temperature_below``\r\n* The ``first_day_below`` and ``first_day_above`` atmos indicators are now deprecated in order to clearly communicate the variables they act upon ([GH/1175](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1175), [PR/1186](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1186)). The suggested migrations are as follows:\r\n    - ``xclim.atmos.first_day_above`` -> ``xclim.indices.first_day_{tn | tg | tx}_above``\r\n    - ``xclim.atmos.first_day_below`` -> ``xclim.indices.first_day_{tn | tg | tx}_below``\r\n* The ``degree_days`` generic indice has been deprecated in favour of ``cumulative_difference`` that is not limited only to temperature variables ([GH/1200](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1200), [PR/1202](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1202)). The indices for ``atmos.{heating | cooling | growing}_degree_days`` are now built from ``generic.cumulative_difference``.\r\n* Running `pytest` now requires the `pytest-xdist` distributed testing dependency. This library has been added to the `dev` requirements and conda environment configuration. ([PR/1203](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1203)).\r\n* Parameters ``reducer`` and ``window`` in ``xclim.indices.rle_statistics`` are now positional. ([PR/1161](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1161)).\r\n* The ``relative_annual_cycle_amplitude`` and ``annual_cycle_amplitude`` have been rewritten to match the version defined in the VALUE project, outputs will change drastically (for the better) ([PR/1198](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1198)).\r\n* English indicator metadata has been adjusted to remove frequencies from fields in the `long_name` of indicators. English indicators now have an explicit `title` and `abstract`. ([GH/936](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/936), [PR/1123](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1123)).\r\n* French indicator metadata translations are now more uniform and more closely follow agreed-upon grammar conventions, while also removing frequency fields in `long_name_fr`. ([GH/936](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/936), [PR/1123](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1123)).\r\n* The ``freshet_start`` indice is now deprecated in favour of ``first_day_temperature_above`` with `thresh='0 degC', window=5`. The `freshet_start` indicator is now based on ``first_day_temperature_above``, but is otherwise unaffected. ([GH/1195](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1195), [PR/1196](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1196)).\r\n* Call signatures for several indices/indicators have been modified to optionally accept `op` for manually setting threshold comparison operators ([GH/1194](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1194), [PR/1197](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1197)). The affected indices and indicators as follows:\r\n   - ``hot_spell_max_length``, ``hot_spell_frequency``, ``cold_spell_days``, ``cold_spell_frequency``, ``heat_wave_index``, ``warm_day_frequency`` (indice only), ``warm_night_frequency`` (indice only), ``dry_days``, ``wetdays``, ``wetdays_prop``.\r\n* Cleaner ``xclim.core.calendar.parse_offset`` : fails on invalid frequencies, return implicit anchors (YS -> JAN, Y -> DEC) and implicit ``is_start_anchored`` (D -> True). ([GH/1213](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1213), , [PR/1217](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1217)).\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n* The docstring of ``cool_night_index`` suggested that `lat` was an optional parameter. This has been corrected. ([GH/1179](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1179), [PR/1180](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1180)).\r\n* The ``mean_radiant_temperature`` indice was accessing hardcoded `lat` and `lon` coordinates from passed DataArrays. This now uses `cf-xarray` accessors. ([PR/1180](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1180)).\r\n* Adopt (and adapt) unit registry declaration and preprocessors from `cf-xarray` to circumvent bugs caused by a refactor in `pint` 0.20. It also cleans the code a little bit. ([GH/1211](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1211), [PR/1212](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1212)).\r\n\r\n### Internal changes\r\n* The documentation build now relies on `sphinx-codeautolink` and `sphinx-copybutton`. ([PR/1182](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1182)).\r\n* Many docstrings did not fully adhere to the [numpy docstring format](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html). Fields and entries for many classes and functions have been adjusted to adhere better. ([PR/1182](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1182)).\r\n* The xdoctest namespace now provides access to session-scoped ``{variable}_dataset`` accessors, as well as a ``path_to_atmos_file`` object. These can be used for running doctests on all variables made in the pytest ``atmosds()`` fixture. ([PR/1882](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1882)).\r\n* Upgrade CodeQL GitHub Action to v2. ([GH/1188](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1188), [PR/1189](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1189)).\r\n* New generic index ``first_day_threshold_reached`` is now used to compose all ``first_day_XYZ`` indices. ([GH/1175](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1175), [PR/1186](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1186)).\r\n* In order to reduce computation footprint, the GitHub CI full testing suite and doctests are now only run once a pull request has been reviewed and approved. The number of simultaneously triggered builds has also been reduced. ([GH/1155](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1155), [PR/1203](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1203)).\r\n* ReadTheDocs now only builds full documentation (including running notebooks) when pull requests are merged to the main branch. ([GH/1155](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1155), [PR/1203](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1203)).\r\n* `xclim` now leverages `pytest-xdist` to distribute tests among Python workers and significantly speed up the testing suite. ([PR/1203](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1203)).\r\n* ``show_versions`` can now accept a list of dependencies so that other libraries can make use of this utility. ([PR/1215](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1215)).\r\n* Pull Requests now are automatically tagged (``CI``, ``docs``, ``indicators``, and/or ``sdba``) according to files modified using the [GitHub Labeler Action](https://github.com/actions/labeler). ([PR/1214](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1214)).\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Ouranosinc/xclim/releases/81859820/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

([GH/1109](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1109), [PR/1115](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1115)).\r\n    - Wrapped SBCK tests are also properly run in the tox testing ensemble. ([PR/1119](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1119)).\r\n* Method ``FAO_PM98`` (based on Penman-Monteith formula) to compute potential evapotranspiration. ([PR/1122](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1122)).\r\n* New indices for droughts: SPI (standardized precipitations) and SPEI (standardized water budgets). ([GH/131](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/131), [PR/1096](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1096)).\r\n* Most numba functions of ``sdba.nbutils`` now use the \"lazy\" compilation mode. This significantly accelerates the import time of xclim. ([GH/1135](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1135), [PR/1167](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1167)).\r\n* Statistical properties and measures from ``xclim.sdba`` are now ``Indicator`` subclasses ([PR/1149](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1149)).\r\n\r\n### New indicators\r\n* `xclim` now has the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index and related indices under a new ``xclim.indices.fire`` module. These indices are also available as indicators. ([GH/1152](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1152), [PR/1159](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1159))\r\n* Drought-related indicators: SPI (standardized precipitations) and SPEI (standardized water budgets). ([GH/131](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/131), [PR/1096](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1096)).\r\n* ``ensembles.create_ensembles`` now accepts a ``realizations`` argument to assign a coordinate to the \"realization\" axis. It also accepts a dictionary as input so that keys are used as that coordinate. ([PR/1153](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1153)).\r\n* ``ensembles.ensemble_percentiles``, ``ensembles.ensemble_mean_std_max_min`` and ``ensembles.change_significance`` now support weights ([PR/1151](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1151)).\r\n* Many generic indicators that compare arrays or against thresholds or now accept an `op` keyword for specifying the logical comparison operation to use in their calculations (i.e. `{\">\", \">=\", \"<\", \"<=, \"!=\", \"==\"}`). ([GH/389](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/389), [PR/1157](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1157)).\r\n    - In order to prevent user error, many of these generic indices now have a ``constrain`` variable that prevents calling an indice with an inappropriate comparison operator. (e.g. The following will raise an error: ``op=\">\", constrain=(\"<\", \"<=\")``). This behaviour has been added to indices accepting ``op`` where appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* `scipy` has been pinned below version 1.9 until `lmoments3` can be adapted to the new API. ([GH/1142](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1142), [PR/1143](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1143)).\r\n* `xclim` now requires `xarray>=2022.06.0`. ([PR/1151](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1151)).\r\n* Documentation CI (ReadTheDocs) builds will now fail if there are any misconfigured pages, internal link/reference warnings, or broken external hyperlinks. ([GH/1094](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1094), [PR/1131](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1131), [GH/1139](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1139), [PR/1140](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1140), [PR/1160](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1160)).\r\n* Call signatures for generic indices have been reordered and/or modified to accept `op`, and optionally `constrain`, in many cases, and `condition`/`conditional`/`operation` has been renamed to `op` for consistency. ([GH/389](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/389), [PR/1157](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1157)). The affected indices are as follows:\r\n    - `get_op`, `compare`, `threshold_count`, `get_daily_events`, `count_level_crossings`, `count_occurrences`, `first_occurrence`, `last_occurrence`, `spell_length`, `thresholded_statistics`, `temperature_sum`, `degree_days`.\r\n* All indices in `xclim.indices.generic` now use `threshold` in lieu of `thresh` for consistency. ([PR/1157](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1157)).\r\n* Existing function ``xclim.indices.generic.compare`` can now be used to construct operations with `op` and `constrain` variables to allow for dynamic comparisons with user input handling. ([GH/389](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/389), [PR/1157](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1157)).\r\n* Two deprecated indices have been removed from `xclim`. ([PR/1157](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1157)):\r\n    - ``xclim.indices._multivariate.daily_freezethaw_cycles`` -> Replaceable with the generic ``multiday_temperature_swing`` with `thresh_tasmax='0 degC'`, `thresh_tasmin='0 degC'`, `window=1`, and `op='sum'`. The indicator version (``xclim.atmos.daily_freezethaw_cycles``) is unaffected.\r\n    - ``xclim.indices.generic.select_time`` -> Was previously moved to ``xclim.core.calendar``.\r\n* The `clix-meta` indicator table parsing function (``xclim.core.utils.adapt_clix_meta_yaml``) has been adapted to support the new \"op\" operator handler. ([PR/1157](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1157)).\r\n* Because they have been re-implemented as ``Indicator`` subclasses, statistical properties and measures of ``xclim.sdba`` no longer preserve attributes of their inputs by default. Use ``xclim.set_options(keep_attrs=True)`` to get the previous behaviour. ([PR/1149](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1149)).\r\n* The ``xclim.indices.generic.extreme_temperature_range`` function has been fixed so it now does what its definition says. Results from ``xclim.indicators.cf.etr`` will change. ([GH/1172](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1172), [PR/1173](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1173)).\r\n* `xclim` now has a dedicated ``indices.fire`` submodule that houses all fire-related indices. The previous ``xclim.indices.fwi`` submodule is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. ([GH/1152](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1152), [PR/1159](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1159)).\r\n* The indicator ``xclim.indicators.atmos.fire_weather_indexes`` and indice ``xclim.indices.fire_weather_indexes`` have both been deprecated and renamed to ``cffwis_indices``. Calls using the previous naming will be removed in a future version. ([PR/1159](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1159)).\r\n* `xclim` now explicitly requires `pybtex` in order to generate documentation. ([PR/1176](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1176)).\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n* Fixed ``saturation_vapor_pressure`` for temperatures in other units than Kelvins (also fixes ``relative_humidity_from_dewpoint``). ([GH/1125](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1125), [PR/1127](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1127)).\r\n* Indicators that do not care about the input frequency of the data will not check the cell methods of their inputs. ([PR/1128](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1128)).\r\n* Fixed the signature and docstring of ``heat_index`` by changing ``tasmax`` to ``tas``. ([GH/1126](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1126), [PR/1128](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1128)).\r\n* Fixed a formatting issue with virtual indicator modules (`_gen_returns_section`) that was creating malformed `Returns` sections in `sphinx`-generated documentation. ([PR/1131](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1131)).\r\n* Fix ``biological_effective_degree_days`` for non-scalar latitudes, when using method \"gladstones\". ([GH/1136](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1136), [PR/1137](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1137)).\r\n* Fixed some ``extlink`` warnings found in `sphinx` and configured ReadTheDocs to use `mamba` as the dependency solver. ([GH/1139](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1139), [PR/1140](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1140)).\r\n* Fixed some broken hyperlinks to articles, users, and external documentation throughout the code base and jupyter notebooks. ([PR/1160](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1160)).\r\n* Removed some artefact reference roles introduced in [PR/1131](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1131) that were causing LaTeX builds of the documentation to fail. ([GH/1154](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1154), [PR/1156](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1156)).\r\n* Fix ``biological_effective_degree_days`` for non-scalar latitudes, when using method \"gladstones\". ([GH/1136](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1136), [PR/1137](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1137)).\r\n* Fixed some ``extlink`` warnings found in `sphinx` and configured ReadTheDocs to use `mamba` as the dependency solver. ([GH/1139](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1139), [PR/1140](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1140)).\r\n* Fixed some broken hyperlinks to articles, users, and external documentation throughout the code base and jupyter notebooks. ([PR/1160](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1160)).\r\n* Addressed a bug that was causing `pylint` to stackoverflow by removing it from the tox configuration. `pylint` should only be called from an active environment. ([PR/1163](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1163))\r\n* Fixed kmeans_reduce_ensemble breaking when using dask arrays ([PR/1170](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1170))\r\n* Addressed a bug that was causing `pylint` to stackoverflow by removing it from the tox configuration. `pylint` should only be called from an active environment. ([PR/1163](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1163))\r\n\r\n### Internal changes\r\n* Marked a test (``test_release_notes_file_not_implemented``) that can only pass when source files are available so that it can easily be skipped on conda-forge build tests. ([GH/1116](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1116), [PR/1117](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1117)).\r\n* Split a few YAML strings found in the virtual modules that regularly issued warnings on the code checking CI steps. ([PR/1118](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1118)).\r\n* Function ``xclim.core.calendar.build_climatology_bounds`` now exposed via `__all__`. ([PR/1146](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1146)).\r\n* Clarifications added to docstring of ``xclim.core.bootstrapping.bootstrap_func``. ([PR/1146](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1146)).\r\n* Bibliographic references for supporting scientific articles are now found in a bibtex file (`docs/references.bib`). These are now made available within the generated documentation using ``sphinxcontrib-bibtex``. ([GH/1094](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1094), [PR/1131](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1131)).\r\n* Added information URLs to ``setup.py`` in order to showcase issue tracker and other sites on PyPI page ([PR/1156](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1156)).\r\n* Configured the LaTeX build of the documentation to ignore the custom bibliographies, as they were redundant in the generated PDF. ([PR/1158](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1158)).\r\n* Run length encoding (``xclim.indices.run_length.rle``) has been optimized. ([GH/956](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/956), [PR/1122](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1122)).\r\n* Added a `sphinx-build -b linkcheck` step to the `tox`-based `\"docs\"` build as well as to the ReadTheDocs configuration. ([PR/1160](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1160)).\r\n* `pylint` is now setup to use a `pylintrc` file, allowing for more granular control of warnings and exceptions. Many errors are still present, so addressing them will need to occur gradually. ([PR/1163](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1163)).\r\n* The generic indices `count_level_crossings`, `count_occurrences`, `first_occurrence`, and `last_occurrence` are now fully tested. ([PR/1157](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1157)).\r\n* Adjusted the ANUCLIM indices by removing \"ANUCLIM\" from their titles, modifying their docstrings, and handling `\"op\"` input in a more user-friendly way. ([GH/1055](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1055), [PR/1169](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1169)).\r\n* Documentation for fire-based indices/indicators has been reorganized to reflect the new submodule structure. ([PR/1159](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1159)).\r\n"}

Python3.10-style annotations are now permitted. ([GH/1065](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1065), [PR/1071](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1071)).\r\n* `xclim` is now fully compatible with `xarray`'s `flox`-enabled ``GroupBy`` and ``resample`` operations. ([PR/1081](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1081)).\r\n* `xclim` now (properly) enforces docstring compliance checks using `pydocstyle` with modified `numpy`-style docstrings. Docstring errors will now cause build failures. See the [pydocstyle documentation](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/error_codes.html) for more information. ([PR/1074](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1074)).\r\n* `xclim` now uses GitHub Actions to manage patch version bumping. Merged Pull Requests that modify `xclim` code now trigger version-bumping automatically when pushed to the main development branch. Running `$ bump2version patch` within development branches is no longer necessary. ([PR/1102](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1102)).\r\n\r\n### New features and enhancements\r\n* Add \"Celsius\" to aliases of \"celsius\" unit. ([GH/1067](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1067), [PR/1068](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1068)).\r\n* All indicators now have indexing enabled, except those computing statistics on spells. ([GH/1069](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1069), [PR/1070](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1070)).\r\n* A convenience function for returning the version numbers for relevant xclim dependencies (``xclim.testing.show_versions``) is now offered. ([PR/1073](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1073)).\r\n    - A CLI version of this function is also available from the command line (`$ xclim show_version_info`). ([PR/1073](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1073)).\r\n* New \"keep_attrs\" option to control the handling of the attributes within the indicators. ([GH/1026](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1026), [PR/1076](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1076)).\r\n* Added a notebook showcasing some simple examples of Spatial Analogues. ([GH/585](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/585), [PR/1075](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1075)).\r\n* ``create_ensembles`` now accepts a glob string to find datasets. ([PR/1081](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1081)).\r\n* Improved percentile based indicators metadata with the window, threshold and climatology period used to compute percentiles. ([GH/1047](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1047), [PR/1050](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1050)).\r\n* New ``xclim.core.calendar.construct_offset``, the inverse operation of ``parse_offset``. ([PR/1090](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1090)).\r\n* Rechunking operations in ``xclim.indices.run_length.rle`` are now synchronized with dask's options. ([PR/1090](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1090)).\r\n* A mention of the \"missing\" checks and options is added to the history attribute of indicators, where appropriate. ([GH/1100](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1100), [PR/1103](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1103)).\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* ``xclim.atmos.water_budget`` has been separated into ``water_budget`` (calculated directly with 'evspsblpot') and ``water_budget_from_tas`` (original function). ([PR/1086](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1086)).\r\n* Injected parameters in indicators are now left out of a function's signature and will not be included in the history attribute. ([PR/1086](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1086)).\r\n* The signature for the following Indicators have been modified ([PR/1050](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1050)):\r\n    - cold_spell_duration_index, tg90p, tg10p, tx90p, tx10p, tn90p, tn10p, warm_spell_duration_index, days_over_precip_doy_thresh, days_over_precip_thresh, fraction_over_precip_doy_thresh, fraction_over_precip_thresh, cold_and_dry_days, warm_and_dry_days, warm_and_wet_days, cold_and_wet_days\r\n* The parameter for percentile values is now named after the variable it is supposed to be computed upon. ([PR/1050](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1050)).\r\n* `pytest-runner` has been removed as a dependency (it was never needed for `xclim` development). ([PR/1074](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1074)).\r\n* `xclim.testing._utils.py` has been renamed to `xclim.testing.utils.py` for added documentation visibility. ([PR/1074](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1074)).\r\n    - Some unused functions and classes (``as_tuple``, ``TestFile``, ``TestDataSet``) have been removed. ([PR/1107](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1107)).\r\n\r\n### New indicators\r\n* ``universal_thermal_climate_index`` and ``mean_radiant_temperature`` for computing the universal thermal climate index from the near-surface temperature, relative humidity, near-surface windspeed and radiation. ([GH/1060](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1060), [PR/1062](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1062)).\r\n    - A new method ``ITS90`` has also been added for calculating saturation water vapour pressure. ([GH/1060](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1060), [PR/1062](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1062)).\r\n\r\n### Internal changes\r\n* Typing syntax has been updated within pre-commit via `isort`. Pre-commit hooks now append `from __future__ import annotations` to all python module imports for backwards compatibility. ([GH/1065](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1065), [PR/1071](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1071))\r\n* `isort` project configurations are now set in `setup.cfg`. ([PR/1071](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1071)).\r\n* Many function docstrings, external target links, and internal section references have been adjusted to reduce warnings when building the docs. ([PR/1074](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1074)).\r\n* Code snippets within documentation are now checked and reformatted to `black` conventions with `blackdoc`. A `pre-commit` hook is now in place to run these checks. ([PR/1098](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1098)).\r\n* Test coverage statistic no longer includes coverage of the test files themselves. Coverage now reflects lines of usable code covered. ([PR/1101](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1101)).\r\n* Reordered listed authors alphabetically. Promoted [@bzah](https://github.com/bzah) to core contributor. ([PR/1105](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1105)).\r\n* Tests have been added for some functions in `xclim.testing.utils.py`; some previously uncaught bugs in ``list_input_variables``, ``publish_release_notes``, and ``show_versions`` have been patched. ([GH/1078](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1078), [PR/1107](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1107)).\r\n* A convenience command for installing xclim with key development branches of some dependencies has been added (`$ make upstream`). ([GH/1088](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1088), [PR/1092](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1092); amended in [GH/1113](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1113), [PR/1114](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1114)).\r\n    - This build configuration is also available in `tox` for local development purposes (`$ tox -e pyXX-upstream`).\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n* Clean the `bias_adjustement` and `history` attributes created by `xclim.sdba.adjust` (e.g. when an argument  is an `xr.DataArray`, only print the name instead of the whole array). ([GH/1083](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1083), [PR/1087](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1087)).\r\n* `pydocstyle` checks were silently failing in the `pre-commit` configuration due to a badly-formed regex. This has been adjusted. ([PR/1074](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1074)).\r\n* `adjust_doy_calendar` was broken when the source or the target were seasonal. ([GH/1097](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1097), [GH/1091](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1091), [PR/1099](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1099))\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Ouranosinc/xclim/releases/69863080/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

([PR/1033](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1033)).\r\n* Parameter ``dmin`` added to spatial analog method \"zech_aslan\", to avoid singularities on identical points. ([PR/1033](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1033)).\r\n* `xclim` is now compatible with changes in `xarray` that enabled explicit indexing operations. ([PR/1038](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1038), [xarray PR](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/5692)).\r\n\r\n### Internal changes\r\n* `xclim` now uses the ``check-json`` and ``pretty-format-json`` pre-commit checks to validate and format JSON files. ([PR/1032](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1032)).\r\n* The few `logging` artifacts in the ``xclim.ensembles`` module have been replaced with `warnings.warn` calls or removed.

([PR/1013](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1013)).\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* The version pin for `bottleneck` (<1.4) has been lifted. ([PR/1013](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1013)).\r\n* `packaging` has been removed from the `xclim` run dependencies. ([PR/1013](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1013)).\r\n* Quantile mapping adjustment objects (EQM, DQM and QDM) and ``sdba.utils.equally_spaced_nodes`` will not add additional endpoints to the quantile range. With those endpoints, variables are capped to the reference's range in the historical period, which can be dangerous with high variability in the extremes (ex: pr), especially if the reference doesn't reproduce those extremes credibly. ([GH/1015](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1015), [PR/1016](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1016)). To retrieve the same functionality as before use:\r\n```\r\nfrom xclim import sdba\r\n# NQ is the the number of equally spaced nodes, the argument previously given to nquantiles directly.\r\nEQM = sdba.EmpiricalQuantileMapping.train(ref, hist, nquantiles=sdba.equally_spaced_nodes(NQ, eps=1e-6), ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n* The \"history\" string attribute added by xclim has been modified for readability: ([GH/963](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/963), [PR/1018](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1018)).\r\n    - The trailing dot (``.``) was dropped.\r\n    - ``None`` inputs are now printed as \"None\" (and not \"<NoneType>\").\r\n    - Arguments are now always shown as keyword-arguments. This mostly impacts ``sdba`` functions, as it was already the case for ``Indicators``.\r\n* The `cell_methods` string attribute appends only the operation from the indicator itself. In previous version, some indicators also appended the input data's own `cell_method`. The clix-meta importer has been modified to follow the same convention. ([GH/983](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/983), [PR/1022](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1022))\r\n\r\n### New features and enhancements\r\n* `publish_release_notes` now leverages much more regular expression logic for link translations to markdown. ([PR/1023](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1023)).\r\n* Improve performances of percentile bootstrap algorithm by using ``xarray.map_block`` ([GH/932](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/932), [PR/1017](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1017)).\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n* Loading virtual python modules with ``build_indicator_module_from_yaml`` is now fixed on some systems where the current directory was not part of python's path. Furthermore, paths of the python and json files can now be passed directly to the ``indices`` and ``translations`` arguments, respectively. ([GH/1020](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1020), [PR/1021](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1021)).\r\n\r\n### Internal changes\r\n* Due to an upstream bug in `bottleneck`'s support of virtualenv, `tox` builds for Python3.10 now depend on a patched fork of `bottleneck`. This workaround will be removed once the fix is merged upstream. ([PR/1013](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1013), see: [bottleneck PR/397](https://github.com/pydata/bottleneck/pull/397/)).\r\n    - This has been removed with the release of [bottleneck version 1.3.4](https://pypi.org/project/Bottleneck/1.3.4/). ([PR/1025](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1025)).\r\n* GitHub CI actions now use the [deadsnakes python PPA Action](https://github.com/deadsnakes/action) for gathering the Python3.10 development headers. ([PR/1013](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1013)).\r\n* The \"is_dayofyear\" attribute added by several indices is now a ``numpy.int32`` instance, instead of python's ``int``. This ensures a THREDDS server can read it when the variable is saved to a netCDF file with `xarray`/`netCDF4-python`.

([PR/1002](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1002)).\r\n* Temporarily pinned `ipython` below version 8.0 due to behaviour causing hangs in GitHub Actions and ReadTheDocs. ([GH/1005](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/1005), [PR/1006](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/1006)).\r\n* ``indices.stats`` methods where adapted to handle dask-backed arrays.

([PR/981](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/981)).\r\n* `xclim` now requires docstrings have valid ReStructuredText formatting to pass basic linting checks. ([PR/993](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/993)). Checks generally require:\r\n    - Working hyperlinks and reference tags.\r\n    - Valid content references (e.g. `:py:func:`).\r\n    - Valid NumPy-formatted docstrings.\r\n* The `xclim` developer community has now adopted the 'Contributor Covenant' Code of Conduct v2.1 (`text <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/>`_). ([GH/948](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/948), [PR/996](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/996)).\r\n\r\n## New indicators\r\n* ``jetstream_metric_woollings`` indicator returns latitude and strength of jet-stream in u-wind field. ([GH/923](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/923), [PR/924](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/924)).\r\n\r\n## New features and enhancements\r\n* Features added and modified to allow proper multivariate adjustments. ([PR/964](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/964)).\r\n    - Added ``xclim.sdba.processing.to_additive_space`` and ``xclim.sdba.processing.from_additive_space`` to transform \"multiplicative\" variables to the additive space. An example of multivariate adjustment using this technique was added to the \"Advanced\" sdba notebook.\r\n    - ``xclim.sdba.processing.normalize`` now also returns the norm. ``xclim.sdba.processing.jitter`` was created by combining the \"under\" and \"over\" methods.\r\n    - ``xclim.sdba.adjustment.PrincipalComponent`` was modified to have a simpler signature. The \"full\" method for finding the best PC orientation was added. ([GH/697](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/697)).\r\n* New ``xclim.indices.stats.parametric_cdf`` function to facilitate the computation of return periods over DataArrays of statistical distribution parameters ([GH/876](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/876), [PR/984](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/984)).\r\n* Add ``copy`` parameter to ``percentile_doy`` to control if the array input can be dumped after computing percentiles ([GH/932](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/932), [PR/985](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/985)).\r\n* New improved algorithm for ``dry_spell_total_length``, performing the temporal indexing at the right moment and with control on the aggregation operator (``op``) for determining the dry spells.\r\n* Added ``properties.py`` and ``measures.py`` in order to perform diagnostic tests of sdba ([GH/424](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/424), [PR/967](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/967)).\r\n* Update how ``percentile_doy`` rechunk the input data to preserve the initial chunk size. This should make the computation memory footprint more predictable ([GH/932](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/932), [PR/987](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/987)).\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n* To reduce import complexity, `select_time` has been refactored/moved from ``xclim.indices.generic`` to ``xclim.core.calendar``. ([GH/949](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/949), [PR/969](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/969)).\r\n* The stacking dimension of ``xclim.sdba.stack_variables`` has been renamed to \"multivar\" to avoid name conflicts with the \"variables\" property of xarray Datasets. ([PR/964](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/964)).\r\n* `xclim` now requires `cf-xarray>=0.6.1`. ([GH/923](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/923), [PR/924](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/924)).\r\n* `xclim` now requires `statsmodels`. ([GH/424](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/424), [PR/967](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/967)).\r\n\r\n## Internal changes\r\n* Added a CI hook in ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` to perform automated `pre-commit` corrections with GitHub CI. ([PR/965](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/965)).\r\n* Adjusted CI hooks to fail earlier if `lint` checks fail. ([PR/972](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/972)).\r\n* `TrainAdjust` and `Adjust` object have a new `skip_input_checks` keyword arg to their `train` and  `adjust` methods. When `True`, all unit-, calendar- and coordinate-related input checks are skipped. This is an ugly solution to disappearing attributes when using `xr.map_blocks` with dask. ([PR/964](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/964)).\r\n* Some slow tests were marked `slow` to help speed up the standard test ensemble. ([PR/969](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/969)).\r\n    - Tox testing ensemble now also reports slowest tests using the ``--durations`` flag.\r\n* `pint` no longer emits warnings about redefined units when the `logging` module is loaded. ([GH/990](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/990), [PR/991](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/991)).\r\n* Added a CI step for cancelling running workflows in pull requests that receive multiple pushes.

Requirements are now:\r\n    - No individual run may report *<80%* code coverage.\r\n    - Some drop in coverage is now tolerable, but runs cannot dip below *-0.25%* relative to the main branch.\r\n\r\n### New features and enhancements\r\n* Added an optimized pathway for ``xclim.indices.run_length`` functions when ``window=1``. ([PR/911](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/911), [GH/910](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/910)).\r\n* The data input frequency expected by ``Indicator`` is now in the ``src_freq`` attribute and is thus controllable by subclassing existing indicators. ([GH/898](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/898), [PR/927](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/927)).\r\n* New ``**indexer`` keyword args added to many indicators, it accepts the same arguments as ``xclim.indices.generic.select_time``, which has been improved. Unless otherwise specified, the time selection is done before any computation. ([PR/934](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/934), [GH/899](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/899)).\r\n* Rewrite of ``xclim.sdba.ExtremeValues``, now fixed with a correct algorithm. It has not been tested extensively and should be considered experimental. ([PR/914](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/914), [GH/789](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/789), [GH/790](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/790)).\r\n* Added `days_over_precip_doy_thresh` and `fraction_over_precip_doy_thresh` indicators to distinguish between WMO and ECAD definition of the Rxxp and RxxpTot indices. ([GH/931](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/931), [PR/940](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/940)).\r\n* Update `xclim.core.utils.nan_calc_percentiles` to improve maintainability. ([PR/942](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/942)).\r\n* Added `heat_index` indicator. Added `heat_index` indicator. This is similar to `humidex` but uses a different dew point as well as heat balance equations which account for variables other than vapor pressure. ([GH/807](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/807)) and ([PR/915](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/915)).\r\n* Added alternative method for ``xclim.indices.potential_evapotranspiration`` based on `mcguinnessbordne05` (from Tanguay et al. 2018). ([PR/926](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/926), [GH/925](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/925)).\r\n* Added `snw_max` and `snw_max_doy` indicators to compute the maximum snow amount and the day of year of the maximum snow amount respectively. ([GH/776](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/776), [PR/950](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/950)).\r\n* Added index for calculating ratio of convective to total precipitation. ([GH/920](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/920), [PR/921](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/921)).\r\n* Added `wetdays_prop` indicator to calculate the proportion of days in a period where the precipitation is greater than a threshold. ([PR/919](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/919), [GH/918](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/918)).\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* Following version 1.9 of the CF Conventions, published in September 2021, the calendar name \"gregorian\" is deprecated. ``core.calendar.get_calendar`` will return \"standard\", even if the underlying cftime objects still use \"gregorian\" (cftime <= 1.5.1). ([PR/935](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/935)).\r\n* ``xclim.sdba.utils.extrapolate_qm`` is now deprecated and will be removed in version 0.33. ([PR/941](https://github.com/Ourano\r\n* Dependency ``pint`` minimum necessary version is now 0.10. ([PR/959](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/959)).\r\nsinc/xclim/pull/941)).\r\n\r\n### Internal changes\r\n* Removed some logging configurations in ``xclim.core.dataflags`` that were polluting python's main logging configuration. ([PR/909](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/909)).\r\n* Synchronized logging formatters in ``xclim.ensembles`` and ``xclim.core.utils``. ([PR/909](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/909)).\r\n* Added a helper function for generating the release notes with dynamically-generated ReStructuredText or Markdown-formatted hyperlinks ([PR/922](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/922), [GH/907](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/907)).\r\n* Split of resampling-related functionality of ``Indicator`` into new ``ResamplingIndicator`` and ``ResamplingIndicatorWithIndexing`` subclasses. The use of new (private) methods makes it easier to inject functionality in indicator subclasses. ([GH/867](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/867), [PR/927](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/927), [PR/934](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/934)).\r\n* French translation metadata fields are now cleaner and much more internally consistent, and many empty metadata fields (e.g. ``comment_fr``) have been removed. ([PR/930](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/930), [GH/929](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/929)).\r\n* Adjustments to the ``tox`` builds so that slow tests are now run alongside standard tests (for more accurate coverage reporting). ([PR/938](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/938)).\r\n* Use ``xarray.apply_ufunc`` to vectorize statistical functions. ([PR/943](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/943)).\r\n* Refactor of ``xclim.sdba.utils.interp_on_quantiles`` so that it now handles the extrapolation directly and to better handle missing values. ([PR/941](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/941)).\r\n* Updated `heating_degree_days` and `fraction_over_precip_thresh` documentations. ([GH/952](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/952), [PR/953](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/953)).\r\n* Added an intersphinx mapping to xarray. ([PR/955](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/955)).\r\n* Added a CodeQL security analysis GitHub CI hook on push to master and on Friday nights. ([PR/960](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/960)).\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n* Fix bugs in the `cf_attrs` and/or `abstract` of `continuous_snow_cover_end` and `continuous_snow_cover_start`. ([PR/908](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/908)).\r\n* Remove unnecessary `keep_attrs` from `resample` call which would raise an error in futur Xarray version. ([PR/937](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/937)).\r\n* Fixed a bug in the regex that parses usernames in the history. ([PR/945](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/945)).\r\n* Fixed a bug in ``xclim.indices.generic.doymax`` and ``xclim.indices.generic.doymin`` that prevented the use of the functions on multidimensional data. ([PR/950](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/950), [GH/951](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/951)).\r\n* Skip all missing values in ``xclim.sdba.utils.interp_on_quantiles``, drop them from both the old and new coordinates, as well as from the old values. ([PR/941](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/941)).\r\n* \"degrees_north\" and \"degrees_east\" (and their variants) are now considered independent units, so that ``pint`` and ``xclim.core.units.ensure_cf_units`` don't convert them to \"deg\". ([PR/959](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/959)).\r\n* Fixed a bug in ``xclim.core.dataflags`` that would misidentify the \"extra\" variable to be called when running multivariate checks. ([PR/957](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/957), [GH/861](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/861)).\r\n"}

([PR/895](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/895), [GH/887](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/887)).\r\n* ``freezing_degree_days`` indicator returns degree-days below a default of `thresh=\"0 degC\"`. ([PR/895](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/895), [GH/887](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/887)).\r\n* Several frost-free season calculations are now available as both indices and indicators. ([PR/895](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/895), [GH/887](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/887)):\r\n    - ``frost_free_season_start``\r\n    - ``frost_free_season_end``\r\n    - ``frost_free_season_length``\r\n* ``growing_season_start`` is now offered as an indice and as an indicator to complement other growing season-based indicators (threshold calculation with `op=\">=\"`). ([PR/895](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/895), [GH/887](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/887)).\r\n\r\n### New features and enhancements\r\n* Improve cell_methods checking to search the wanted method within the whole string. ([PR/866](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/866), [GH/863](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/863)).\r\n* New ``align_on='random`` option for ``xclim.core.calendar.convert_calendar``, for conversions involving '360_day' calendars. ([PR/875](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/875), [GH/841](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/841)).\r\n* ``dry_spell_frequency`` now has a parameter `op: {\"sum\", \"max\"}` to choose if the threshold is compared against the accumulated or maximal precipitation, over the given window. ([PR/879](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/879)).\r\n* ``maximum_consecutive_frost_free_days`` is now checking that the minimum temperature is above or equal to the threshold ( instead of only above). ([PR/883](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/883), [GH/881](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/881)).\r\n* The ANUCLIM virtual module has been updated to accept weekly and monthly inputs and with improved metadata. ([PR/885](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/885), [GH/538](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/538))\r\n* The ``sdba.loess`` algorithm has been optimized to run faster in all cases, with an even faster special case (``equal_spacing=True``) when the x coordinate is equally spaced. When activated, this special case might return results different from without, up to around 0.1%. ([PR/865](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/865)).\r\n* Add support for group's window and additional dimensions in ``LoessDetrend``. Add new ``RollingMeanDetrend`` object. ([PR/865](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/865)).\r\n* Missing value algorithms now try to infer the source timestep of the input data when it is not given. ([PR/885](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/885)).\r\n* On indices, `bootstrap` parameter documentation has been updated to explain when and why it should be used. ([PR/893](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/893), [GH/846](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/846)).\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* Major changes in the YAML schema for virtual submodules, now closer to how indicators are declared dynamically, see the doc for details. ([PR/849](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/849), [GH/848](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/848)).\r\n* Removed ``xclim.generic.daily_downsampler``, as it served no purpose now that xarray's resampling works with cftime ([PR/888](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/888), [GH/889](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/889)).\r\n* Refactor of ``xclim.core.calendar.parse_offset``, output types were changed to useful ones ([PR/885](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/885)).\r\n* Major changes on how parameters are passed to indicators. ([PR/873](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/873)):\r\n    - Their signature is now consistent : input variables (DataArrays, optional or not) are positional or keyword arguments and all other parameters are keyword only. ([GH/855](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/855), [GH/857](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/857))\r\n    - Some indicators have modified signatures because we now rename variables when wrapping generic indices. This is the case for the whole cf module, for example.\r\n    - ``Indicator.parameters`` is now a property generated from ``Indicator._all_parameters``, as the latter includes the injected parameters. The keys of the former are instances of new ``xclim.core.indicator.Parameter``, and not dictionaries as before.\r\n    - New ``Indicator.injected_parameters`` to see which compute function arguments will be injected at call time.\r\n    - See the pull request ([PR/873](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/873)) for all information.\r\n* The call signature for ``huglin_index`` has been modified to reflect the correct variables used in its formula (`tasmin` -> `tas`; `thresh_tasmin` -> `thresh`). ([PR/903](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/903), [GH/902](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/902)).\r\n\r\n### Internal changes\r\n* Pull Request contributions now require hyperlinks to the issue and pull request pages on GitHub listed alongside changess in HISTORY.rst. ([PR/860](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/860),[GH/854](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/854)).\r\n* Updated the contribution guidelines to better give credit to contributors and more easily track changes. ([PR/869](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/869), [GH/868](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/868)).\r\n* Enabled coveralls code coverage reporting for GitHub CI. ([PR/870](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/870)).\r\n* Added automated TestPyPI and PyPI-publishing workflows for GitHub CI. ([PR/872](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/872)).\r\n* Changes on how indicators are constructed. ([PR/873](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/873)).\r\n* Added missing algorithms tests for conversion from hourly to daily. ([PR/888](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/888)).\r\n* Updated pre-commit hooks to use black v21.10.b0. ([PR/896](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/896)).\r\n* Moved ``stack_variables``, ``unstack_variables``, ``construct_moving_yearly_window`` and ``unpack_moving_yearly_window`` from ``xclim.sdba.base`` to ``xclim.sdba.processing``. They still are imported in ``xclim.sdba`` as before. ([PR/892](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/892)).\r\n* Many improvements to the documentation. ([PR/892](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/892), [GH/880](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/880)).\r\n* Added regex replacement handling in setup.py to facilitate publishing contributor/contribution links on PyPI. ([PR/906](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/906)).\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n* Fix a bug in bootstrapping where computation would fail when the dataset time coordinate is encoded using `cftime.datetime`. ([PR/859](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/859)).\r\n* Fix a bug in ``build_indicator_module_from_yaml`` where bases classes (Daily, Hourly, etc) were not usable with the `base` field. ([PR/885](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/885)).\r\n* ``percentile_doy`` alpha and beta parameters are now properly transmitted to bootstrap calls of this function. ([PR/893](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/893), [GH/846](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/issues/846)).\r\n* When called with a 1D da and ND index, ``xclim.indices.run_length.lazy_indexing`` now drops the auxiliary coordinate corresponding to da's index. This fixes a bug with ND data in ``xclim.indices.run_length.season``. ([PR/900](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/900)).\r\n* Fix name of heating degree days in French (`\"chauffe\"` -> \"`chauffage`\"). ([PR/895](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/pull/895)).\r\n* Corrected several French indicator translation description strings (bad usages of `\".\"` in `description` and `long_name` fields).

A moving window averaging of days can also be supplied (default:`window=1`).\r\n* ``within_bnds_doy`` indice returns a boolean array indicating whether or not array's values are within bounds for each day of the year.\r\n* Added ``atmos.wet_precip_accumulation``, an indicator accumulating precipitation over wet days.\r\n* Module ICCLIM now includes ``PRCPTOT``, which accumulates precipitation for days with precipitation above 1 mm/day.\r\n\r\n## New features and enhancements\r\n* ``xclim.core.utils.nan_calc_percentiles`` now uses a custom algorithm instead of ``numpy.nanpercentiles`` to have more flexibility on the interpolation method. The performance is also improved.\r\n* ``xclim.core.calendar.percentile_doy`` now uses the 8th method of Hyndman & Fan for linear interpolation (alpha = beta = 1/3). Previously, the function used Numpy's percentile, which corresponds to the 7th method. This change is motivated by the fact that the 8th is recommended by Hyndman & Fay, and it ensures consistency with other climate indices packages (`climdex`, `icclim`). Using `alpha = beta = 1` restores the previous behaviour.\r\n* ``xclim.core.utils._cal_perc`` is now only a proxy for ``xc.core.utils.nan_calc_percentiles`` with some axis moves.\r\n* `xclim` now implements many data quality assurance flags (``xclim.core.dataflags``) for temperature and precipitation based on `ICCLIM documentation guidelines <https://eca.knmi.nl/documents/atbd.pdf>`_. These checks include the following:\r\n    - Temperature (variables: ``tas``, ``tasmin``, ``tasmax``): ``tasmax_below_tasmin``, ``tas_exceeds_tasmax``, ``tas_below_tasmin``, ``temperature_extremely_low`` (`thresh=\"-90 degC\"`), ``temperature_extremely_high`` (`thresh=\"60 degC\"`).\r\n    - Precipitation-specific (variables: ``pr``, ``prsn``, ):  ``negative_accumulation_values``, ``very_large_precipitation_events`` (`thresh=\"300 mm d-1\"`).\r\n    - Wind-specific (variables: ``sfcWind``, ``wsgsmax``/``sfcWindMax``): ``wind_values_outside_of_bounds``\r\n    - Generic: ``outside_n_standard_deviations_of_climatology``, ``values_repeating_for_n_or_more_days``, ``values_op_thresh_repeating_for_n_or_more_days``, ``percentage_values_outside_of_bounds``.\r\n\r\n    These quality-assurance checks are selected according to CF-standard variable names, and can be triggered via ``xclim.core.dataflags.data_flags(xarray.DataArray, xarray.Dataset)``. These checks are separate from the Indicator-defined `datachecks` and must be launched manually. They'll return an array of data_flags as boolean variables.\r\n    If called with `raise_flags=True`, will raise an Exception with comments for each quality control check raised.\r\n* A convenience function (``xclim.core.dataflags.ecad_compliant``) is also offered as a method for asserting that data adheres to all relevant ECAD/ICCLIM checks. For more information on usage, consult the docstring/documentation.\r\n* A new utility \"``dataflags``\" is also available for performing fast quality control checks from the command-line (`xclim dataflags --help`). See the CLI documentation page for usage examples.\r\n* Added missing typed call signatures, expected returns and docstrings for many ``xclim.core.calendar`` functions.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n* All \"ANUCLIM\" indices and indicators have lost their `src_timestep` argument. Most of them were not using it and now every function infers the frequency from the data directly. This may add stricter constraints on the time coordinate, the same as for ``xarray.infer_freq``.\r\n* Many functions found within ``xclim.core.cfchecks`` (``generate_cfcheck`` and ``check_valid_*``) have been removed as existing indicator CF-standard checks and data checks rendered them redundant/obsolete.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Fixes in ``sdba`` for (1) inputs with dimensions without coordinates, for (2) ``sdba.detrending.MeanDetrend`` and for (3) ``DetrendedQuantileMapping`` when used with dask's distributed scheduler.\r\n* Replaced instances of `'\u25e6'` (\"White bullet\") with `'\u00b0'` (\"Degree Sign\") in ``icclim.yaml`` as it was causing issues for non-UTF8 environments.\r\n* Addressed an edge case where ``test_sdba::test_standardize`` randomness could generate values that surpass the test error tolerance.\r\n* Added a missing `.txt` file to the MANIFEST of the source distributable in order to be able to run all tests.\r\n* ``xc.core.units.rate2amount`` is now exact when the sampling frequency is monthly, seasonal or yearly. Earlier, monthly and yearly data were computed using constant month and year length. End-of-period frequencies are also correctly understood (ex: \"M\" vs \"MS\").\r\n* In the ``potential_evapotranspiration`` indice, add abbreviated ``method`` names to docstring.\r\n* Fixed an issue that prevented using the default ``group`` arg in adjustment objects.\r\n* Fix bug in ``missing_wmo``, where a period would be considered valid if all months met WMO criteria, but complete months in a year were missing. Now, if any month does not meet criteria or is absent, the period will be considered missing.\r\n* Fix bootstrapping with dask arrays. Dask does not support using ``loc`` with multiple indexes to set new values, so a workaround was necessary.\r\n* Fix bootstrapping when the bootstrapped year must be converted to a 366_day calendar.\r\n* Virtual modules and translations now use 'UTF-8' by default when reading yaml or json file, instead of a machine-dependent encoding.\r\n\r\n## Internal Changes\r\n* `xclim` code quality checks now use the newest `black` (v21.8-beta). Checks launched via `tox` and `pre-commit` now run formatting modifications over Jupyter notebooks found under `docs`.\r\n"}

It is now hidden from ``xclim.sdba`` but can still be accessed via ``xclim.sdba.adjustment``, with a warning. Work on improving the algorithm is ongoing, and a better implementation will be in a future version.\r\n* It was found that the ``add_dims`` argument of ``sdba.Grouper`` had some caveats throughout ``sdba``. This argument is to be used with care before a careful analysis and more testing is done within ``xclim``.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* ``xclim`` has switched back to updating the ``history`` attribute (instead of ``xclim_history``). This impacts all indicators, most ensemble functions, ``percentile_doy`` and ``sdba.processing`` (see below).\r\n* Refactor of ``sdba.processing``. Now all functions take one or more dataarrays as input, plus some parameters. And output one or more dataarrays (not Datasets). Units and metadata is handled. This impacts ``sdba.processing.adapt_freq`` especially.\r\n* Add unit handling in ``sdba``. Most parameters involving quantities are now expecting strings (and not numbers). Adjustment objects will ensure ref, hist and sim all have the same units (taking ref as reference).\r\n* The Adjustment` classes of ``xclim.sdba`` have been refactored into 2 categories:\r\n    - ``TrainAdjust`` objects (most of the algorithms), which are created **and** trained in the same call:\r\n      ``obj = Adj.train(ref, hist, **kwargs)``. The ``.adjust`` step stays the same.\r\n    - ``Adjust`` objects (only ``NpdfTransform``), which are never initialized. Their ``adjust``\r\n      class method performs all the work in one call.\r\n* ``snowfall_approximation`` used a `\"<\"` condition instead of `\"<=\"` to determine the snow fraction based on the freezing point temperature. The new version sticks to the convention used in the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS).\r\n* Removed the `\"gis\"`, `\"docs\"`, `\"test\"` and `\"setup\"`extra dependencies from ``setup.py``. The ``dev`` recipe now includes all tools needed for xclim's development.\r\n\r\n### New features and enhancements\r\n* ``snowfall_approximation`` has gained support for new estimation methods used in CLASS: 'brown' and 'auer'.\r\n* A ``ValidationError`` will be raised if temperature units are given as 'deg C', which is misinterpreted by pint.\r\n* Functions computing run lengths (sequences of consecutive `\"True\"` values) now take the ``index`` argument. Possible values are ``first`` and ``last``, indicating which item in the run should be used to index the run length. The default is set to `\"first\"`, preserving the current behavior.\r\n* New ``sdba_encode_cf`` option to workaround a cftime/xarray performance issue when using dask.\r\n\r\n### New indicators\r\n* ``effective_growing_degree_days`` indice returns growing degree days using dynamic start and end dates for the growing season (based on Bootsma et al. (2005)). This has also been wrapped as an indicator.\r\n* ``qian_weighted_mean_average`` (based on Qian et al. (2010)) is offered as an alternate method for determining the start date using a weighted 5-day average (``method=\"qian\"``). Can also be used directly as an indice.\r\n* ``cold_and_dry_days`` indicator returns the number of days where the mean daily temperature is below the 25th percentile and the mean daily precipitation is below the 25th percentile over period. Added as ``CD`` indicator to ICCLIM module.\r\n* ``warm_and_dry_days`` indicator returns the number of days where the mean daily temperature is above the 75th percentile and the mean daily precipitation is below the 25th percentile over period. Added as ``WD`` indicator to ICCLIM module.\r\n* ``warm_and_wet_days`` indicator returns the number of days where the mean daily temperature is above the 75th percentile and the mean daily precipitation is above the 75th percentile over period. Added as ``WW`` indicator to ICCLIM module.\r\n* ``cold_and_wet_days`` indicator returns the number of days where the mean daily temperature is below the 25th percentile and the mean daily precipitation is above the 75th percentile over period. Added as ``CW`` indicator to ICCLIM module.\r\n* ``calm_days`` indicator returns the number of days where surface wind speed is below threshold.\r\n* ``windy_days`` indicator returns the number of days where surface wind speed is above threshold.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n* Various bug fixes in bootstrapping:\r\n   - in ``percentile_bootstrap`` decorator, fix the popping of bootstrap argument to propagate in to the function call.\r\n   - in ``bootstrap_func``, fix some issues with the resampling frequency which was not working when anchored.\r\n* Made argument ``thresh`` of ``sdba.LOCI`` required, as not giving it raised an error. Made defaults explicit in the adjustments docstrings.\r\n* Fixes in ``sdba.processing.adapt_freq`` and ``sdba.nbutils.vecquantiles`` when handling all-nan slices.\r\n* Dimensions in a grouper's ``add_dims`` are now taken into consideration in function wrapped with ``map_blocks/groups``. This feature is still not fully tested throughout ``sdba`` though, so use with caution.\r\n* Better dtype preservation throughout ``sdba``.\r\n* \"constant\" extrapolation in the quantile mappings' adjustment is now padding values just above and under the target's max and min, instead of ``\u00b1np.inf``.\r\n* Fixes in ``sdba.LOCI`` for the case where a grouping with additionnal dimensions is used.\r\n\r\n### Internal Changes\r\n* The behaviour of ``xclim.testing._utils.getfile`` was adjusted to launch file download requests for web-hosted md5 files for every call to compare against local test data.\r\n  This was done to validate that locally-stored test data is identical to test data available online, without resorting to git-based actions. This approach may eventually be revised/optimized in the future.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Ouranosinc/xclim/releases/48674241/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}}

Uses new ``sdba.utils.rand_rot_matrix``. *Experimental, subject to changes.*\r\n* New ``sdba.processing.standardize``, ``.unstandardize`` and  ``.reordering``. All of them, tools needed to replicate Cannon's MBCn algorithm.\r\n* New ``sdba.processing.escore``, backed by  ``sdba.nbutils._escore`` to evaluate the performance of the N pdf transform.\r\n* New function ``xclim.indices.clausius_clapeyron_scaled_precipitation`` can be used to scale precipitation according to changes in mean temperature.\r\n* Percentile based indices gained a ``bootstrap`` argument that applies a bootstrapping algorithm to reduce biases on exceedance frequencies computed over *in base* and *out of base* periods. *Experimental, subject to changes.*\r\n* Added a `.zenodo.json` file for collecting and maintaining author order and tracking ORCIDs.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Various bug fixes in sdba :\r\n\r\n    - in ``QDM.adjust``, fix bug occuring with coords of 'object' dtype and ``interp='nearest'``.\r\n    - in ``nbutils.quantiles``, fix dtype bug when using ``float32`` data.\r\n    - raise a proper error when ``ref`` and ``hist`` have a different calendar for map_blocks-backed adjustments.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n* ``spatial_analogs`` does not support sequence of ``dist_dim`` anymore. Users are responsible for stacking dimensions prior to calling ``spatial_analogs``.\r\n\r\n## New indicators\r\n* ``biologically_effective_degree_days`` (with ``method=\"gladstones\"``) indice computes degree-days between two specific dates, with a capped daily max value as well as latitude and temperature range swing as modifying coefficients (based on Gladstones, J. (1992)). This has also been wrapped as an indicator.\r\n* An alternative implementation of ``biologically_effective_degree_days`` (with ``method=\"icclim\"``, based on ICCLIM formula) ignores latitude and temperature range swing modifiers and uses an alternate ``end_date``. Wrapped and available as an ICCLIM indicator.\r\n* ``cool_night_index`` indice returns the mean minimum temperature in September (``lat >= 0`` deg N) or March (``lat < 0`` deg N), based on Tonietto & Carbonneau, 2004 (10.1016/j.agrformet.2003.06.001). Also available as an indicator (see indices `Notes` section on indicator usage recommendations).\r\n* ``latitude_temperature_index`` indice computes LTI values based on mean temperature of warmest month and a parameterizable latitude coefficient (default: ``lat_factor=75``) based on Jackson & Cherry, 1988, and Kenny & Shao, 1992 (10.1080/00221589.1992.11516243). This has also been wrapped as an indicator.\r\n* ``huglin_index`` indice computes Huglin Heliothermal Index (HI) values based on growing degrees and a latitude-influenced coefficient for day-length (based on Huglin. (1978)). The indice supports several methods of estimating the latitude coefficient:\r\n\r\n    - ``method=\"smoothed\"``: Marks latitudes between -40 N and 40 N with ``k=1``, and linearly increases to ``k=1.06`` at ``|lat|==50``.\r\n    - ``method=\"icclim\"``: Uses a stepwise function based on the the original method as presented by Huglin (1978). Identical to the ICCLIM implementation.\r\n    - ``method=\"jones\"``: Uses a more robust calculation for calculating day-lengths, based on Hall & Jones (2010). This method is now also available for ``biologically_effective_degree_days``.\r\n\r\n* The generic indice ``day_length``, used for calculating approximate daily day-length in hours per day or, given ``start_date`` and ``end_date``, the total aggregated day-hours over period. Uses axial tilt, start and end dates, calendar, and approximate date of northern hemisphere summer solstice, based on Hall & Jones (2010).\r\n\r\n## Internal Changes\r\n* ``aggregate_between_dates`` (introduced in v0.27.0) now accepts ``DayOfYear``-like strings for supplying start and end dates (e.g. ``start=\"02-01\", end=\"10-31\"``).\r\n* The indicator call sequence now considers \"variable\" the inputs annoted so. Dropped the ``nvar`` attribute.\r\n* Default cfcheck is now to check metadata according to the variable name, using CMIP6 names in xclim/data/variable.yml.\r\n* ``Indicator.missing`` defaults to \"skip\" if ``freq`` is absent from the list of parameters.\r\n* Minor modifications to the GitHub Pull Requests template.\r\n* Simplification of some yaml elements for virtual modules.\r\n* Allow injecting ``freq`` without the missing checks failing."}

Rewrite of some parts of the algorithms with numba-accelerated code.\r\n* \"GFWED\" specifics for fire weather computation implemented back into the FWI module. Outputs are within 3% of GFWED data.\r\n* Addition of the `run_length_ufunc` option to control which run length algorithm gets run. Defaults stay the same (automatic switch dependent of the input array : the 1D version is used with non-dask arrays with less than 9000 points per slice).\r\n* Indicator modules built from YAML can now use custom indices. A mapping or module of them can be given to ``build_indicator_module_from_yaml`` with the ``indices`` keyword.\r\n* Virtual submodules now include an `iter_indicators` function to iterate over the pairs of names and indicator objects in that module.\r\n* The indicator string formatter now accepts a \"r\" modifier which passes the raw strings instead of the adjective version.\r\n* Addition of the `sdba_extra_output` option to adds extra diagnostic variables to the outputs of Adjustment objects. Implementation of `sim_q` in QuantileDeltaMapping and `nclusters` in ExtremeValues.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n* The `tropical_nights` indice is being deprecated in favour of `tn_days_above` with ``thresh=\"20 degC\"``. The indicator remains valid, now wrapping this new indice.\r\n* Results of ``sdba.Grouper.apply`` for ``Grouper``s without a group (ex: ``Grouper('time')``) will contain a ``group`` singleton dimension.\r\n* The `daily_freezethaw_cycles` indice is being deprecated in favour of `multiday_temperature_swing`` with temp thresholds at 0 degC and `window=1, op=\"sum\"`. The indicator remains valid, now wrapping this new indice.\r\n* CMIP6 variable names have been adopted whenever possible in xclim. Changes are:\r\n\r\n    - ``swe`` is now ``snw`` (``snw`` is the snow amount [kg / m\u00b2] and ``swe`` the liquid water equivalent thickness [m])\r\n    - ``rh`` is now ``hurs``\r\n    - ``dtas`` is now ``tdps``\r\n    - ``ws`` (in FWI) is now ``sfcWind``\r\n    - ``sic`` is now ``siconc``\r\n    - ``area`` (of sea ice indicators) is now ``areacello``\r\n    - Indicators ``RH`` and ``RH_FROMDEWPOINT`` have be renamed to ``HURS`` and ``HURS_FROMDEWPOINT``. These are changes in the _identifiers_, the python names (``relative_humidity[...]``) are unchanged.\r\n\r\n## New indicators\r\n* `atmos.corn_heat_units` computes the daily temperature-based index for corn growth.\r\n* New indices and indicators for `tx_days_below`, `tg_days_above`, `tg_days_below`, and `tn_days_above`.\r\n* `atmos.humidex` returns the Canadian *humidex*, an indicator of perceived temperature account for relative humidity.\r\n* `multiday_temperature_swing` indice for returning general statistics based on spells of doubly-thresholded temperatures (Tmin < T1, Tmax > T2).\r\n* New indicators `atmos.freezethaw_frequency`, `atmos.freezethaw_spell_mean_length`, `atmos.freezethaw_spell_max_length` for statistics of Tmin < 0 degC and Tmax > 0 deg C days now available (wrapped from `multiday_temperature_swing`).\r\n* `atmos.wind_chill_index` computes the daily wind chill index. The default is similar to what Environment and Climate Change Canada does, options are tunable to get the version of the National Weather Service.\r\n\r\n## Internal Changes\r\n* `run_length.rle_statistics` now accepts a `window` argument.\r\n* Common arguments to the `op` parameter now have better adjective and noun formattings.\r\n* Added and adjusted typing in call signatures and docstrings, with grammar fixes, for many `xclim.indices` operations.\r\n"}

The `cfprobe` method has been renamed to `cfcheck` and the `validate`\r\n  method has been renamed to `datacheck`. More importantly, instantiating `Indicator` creates a new subclass on\r\n  the fly and stores it in a registry, allowing users to subclass existing indicators easily. The algorithm for\r\n  missing values is identified by its registered name, e.g. \"any\", \"pct\", etc, along with its `missing_options`.\r\n* xclim now requires xarray\u00a0>= 0.16, ensuring that xclim.sdba is fully functional.\r\n* The dev requirements now include `xdoctest` -- a rewrite of the standard library module, `doctest`.\r\n* `xclim.core.locales.get_local_attrs` now uses the indicator's class name instead of the indicator itself and no\r\n  longer accepts the `fill_missing` keyword. Behaviour is now the same as passing `False`.\r\n* `Indicator.cf_attrs` is now a list of dictionaries. `Indicator.json` puts all the metadata attributes in the key \"outputs\" (a list of dicts).\r\n  All variable metadata (names in `Indicator._cf_names`) might be strings or lists of strings when accessed as object attributes.\r\n* Passing doctests are now strictly enforced as a build requirement in the Travis CI testing ensemble.\r\n\r\n## New features and enhancements\r\n\r\n* New `ensembles.kkz_reduce_ensemble` method to select subsets of an ensemble based on the KKZ algorithm.\r\n* Create new Indicator `Daily`, `Daily2D` subclasses for indicators using daily input data.\r\n* The `Indicator` class now supports outputing multiple indices for the same inputs.\r\n* `xclim.core.units.declare_units` now works with indices outputting multiple DataArrays.\r\n* Doctests now make use of the `xdoctest_namespace` in order to more easily access mdoules and tesdata.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix `generic.fit` dimension ordering. This caused errors when \"time\" was not the first dimension in a DataArray.\r\n\r\n## Internal changes\r\n\r\n* `datachecks.check_daily` now uses `xr.infer_freq`.\r\n* Indicator subclasses `Tas`, `Tasmin`, `Tasmax`, `Pr` and `Streamflow` now inherit from `Daily`.\r\n* Indicator subclasses `TasminTasmax` and `PrTas` now inherit from `Daily2D`.\r\n* Docstring style now enforced using the `pydocstyle` with `numpy` doctsring conventions.\r\n* Doctests are now performed for all docstring `Examples` using `xdoctest`. Failing examples must be explicitly skipped otherwise build will now fail.\r\n* Indicator methods `update_attrs` and `format` are now classmethods, attrs to update must be passed.\r\n* Indicators definitions without an accompanying translation (presently French) will cause build failures.\r\n* Major refactoring of the internal marchinery of `Indicator` to support multiple outputs."}
