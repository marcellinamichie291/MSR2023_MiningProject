The resolutions are often so large that the images can be problematic and there are often better alternatives (e.g. specifying a lores stream and displaying that instead).\r\n* The preview window implementations are changed to preserve image aspect ratios which they did not previously. The Qt variants also respect resize events.\r\n"}
