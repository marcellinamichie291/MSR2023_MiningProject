The former is the wrapped ``RandomState``, fast, but not cryptographically secure; the latter is the secure random source provided by the OS, which can be rather slow.\r\n\r\n* ADDED: a high-level API hiding the Reikna details and removing some boilerplate.\r\n\r\n* ADDED: shape checks in gate functions that take into account possible broadcasting.\r\n\r\n* ADDED: ``dumps()`` and ``loads()`` methods for ``NuFHESecretKey``, ``NuFHECloudKey`` and ``LweSampleArray`` for serializing to/from bytestrings. The ``Context``'s ``load_secret_key``, ``load_cloud_key`` and ``load_ciphertext`` also take bytestrings as arguments.\r\n\r\n* ADDED: exposed ``clear_computation_cache()`` which helps release the resources associated with a GPU context (the NuFHE ``Context`` objects call it automatically on destruction).\r\n\r\n* ADDED: a ``find_devices()`` function to help with using multiple computation devices, and a corresponding keyword ``device_id`` for ``Context`` class constructor that uses its return values.\r\n\r\n* ADDED: an example of multi-threaded multi-GPU usage.\r\n\r\n* FIXED: a bug in ``tlwe_noiseless_trivial()`` occasionally leading to memory corruption.\r\n\r\n* FIXED: a bug where ``PerformanceParameters`` and ``PerformanceParametersForDevice`` objects did not have a correct equality implementation, leading to unnecessary re-compilation of kernels.\r\n\r\n* FIXED: compilation failing when ``transforms_per_block`` in ``PerformanceParameters`` is set too high."}
