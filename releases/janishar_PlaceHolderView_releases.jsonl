Undo last swipe: This will allow to put the last swiped view back on the top.\nExample:\n\n``` java\n//It initializes the Undo functionality\nmSwipePlaceHolderView.getBuilder() .setIsUndoEnabled(true)\n\n//To undo call this method\nmSwipePlaceHolderView.undoLastSwipe();\n```\n\nIII. Putback swiped view: This functionality enable the card to be swiped and then animate back on the top. So, user is not able to swipe other cards other than top.\n\nExample:\n\n``` java\n//Activates the Putback functionality\nmSwipePlaceHolderView.activatePutBack();\n\n//Deactivates the Putback functionality\nmSwipePlaceHolderView.deActivatePutBack();\n```\n\nIV. Lock view: This allows the card to be locked. The user will not be able to swipe the locked cards.\n\nExample:\n\n``` java\n//It locks the card view\nmSwipePlaceHolderView.lockViews();\n\n//It Unlocks the locked card view\nmSwipePlaceHolderView.unlockViews();\n```\n"}
