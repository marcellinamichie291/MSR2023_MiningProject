For other architectures or for the latest features, refer to the [README.md](README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) files for advanced installation instructions.\r\n\r\n### Environments\r\n\r\nTorchRL currently supports gym and dm_control out-of-the-box. To create a gym wrapped environment, simply use\r\n```python\r\nfrom torchrl.envs import GymEnv, GymWrapper\r\nenv = GymEnv(\"Pendulum-v1\")\r\n# similarly\r\nenv = GymWrapper(gym.make(\"Pendulum-v1\"))\r\n```\r\nEnvironment can be transformed using the `torchrl.envs.transforms` module. See the [environment tutorial](tutorials/envs.ipynb) for more information. \r\nThe [`ParallelEnv`](torchrl/envs/vec_env.py) allows to run multiple environments in parallel.\r\n\r\n### Policy and modules\r\n\r\nTorchRL modules interacts using `TensorDict`, a new data carrier class. Although it is not necessary to use it and one can find workarounds for it, we advise to use the [`TensorDictModule`](torchrl/modules/tensordict_module) class to read tensordicts:\r\n```python\r\nfrom torchrl.modules import TensorDictModule\r\n>>> policy_module = nn.Linear(n_obs, n_act)\r\n>>> policy = TensorDictModule(policy_module, \r\n...   in_keys=[\"observation\"],  # keys to be read for the module input\r\n...   out_keys=[\"action\"],  # keys to be written with the module output\r\n)\r\n>>> tensordict = env.reset()\r\n>>> tensordict = policy(tensordict)\r\n>>> action = tensordict[\"action\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy using `TensorDict` and `TensorDictModule`, you can make sure that your algorithm is robust to changes in configuration (e.g. usage of an RNN for the policy, exploration strategies etc.) `TensorDict` instances can be reshaped in several ways, cast to device, updated, shared among processes, stacked, concatenated etc.\r\n\r\nSome specialized `TensorDictModule` are implemented for convenience: `Actor`, `ProbabilisticActor`, `ValueOperator`, `ActorCriticOperator`, `ActorCriticWrapper` and `QValueActor` can be found in [actors.py](torchrl/modules/tensordict_module/actors.py). \r\n\r\n### Collecting data\r\n\r\n[DataColllectors](torchrl/collectors/collectors.py) is the TorchRL data loading class family. We provide single process, sync and async multiprocess loaders. We also provide [`ReplayBuffers`](torchrl/data/replay_buffers) that can be stored in memory or on disk using the various [storage](torchrl/data/replay_buffers/storages.py) options.\r\n\r\n### Loss modules and advantage computation\r\n\r\n[Loss modules](torchrl/objectives/costs) are provided for each algorithm class independently. They are accompanied by efficient implementations of [value and advantage computation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/rl/tree/main/torchrl/objectives/returns) functions. \r\nTorchRL is devoted to be fully compatible with [functorch](https://github.com/pytorch/functorch), the functional programming PyTorch library.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nA bunch of examples are provided as well. Check the [`examples`](examples) directory to learn more about exploration strategies, loss modules etc.\r\n"}
