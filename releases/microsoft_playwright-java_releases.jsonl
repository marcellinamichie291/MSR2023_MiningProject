Perform actions ...\r\n\r\n// Close context to ensure HAR is saved to disk.\r\ncontext.close();\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse the new methods  [`page.routeFromHAR()`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-page#page-route-from-har) or [`browserContext.routeFromHAR()`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-route-from-har) to serve matching responses from the [HAR](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/) file:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\ncontext.routeFromHAR(Paths.get(\"example.har\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nRead more in [our documentation](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/network#record-and-replay-requests).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Advanced Routing\r\n\r\nYou can now use [`route.fallback()`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-route#route-fallback) to defer routing to other handlers.\r\n\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Remove a header from all requests.\r\npage.route(\"**/*\", route -> {\r\n  Map<String, String> headers = new HashMap<>(route.request().headers());\r\n  headers.remove(\"X-Secret\");\r\n  route.resume(new Route.ResumeOptions().setHeaders(headers));\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Abort all images.\r\npage.route(\"**/*\", route -> {\r\n  if (\"image\".equals(route.request().resourceType()))\r\n    route.abort();\r\n  else\r\n    route.fallback();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the new methods [`page.routeFromHAR()`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-page#page-route-from-har) and [`browserContext.routeFromHAR()`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-route-from-har)also participate in routing and could be deferred to.\r\n\r\n### Web-First Assertions Update\r\n\r\n* New method [`assertThat(locator).hasValues()`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/test-assertions#locator-assertions-to-have-values) that asserts all selected values of `<select multiple>` element.\r\n* Methods [`assertThat(locator).containsText()`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/test-assertions#locator-assertions-to-contain-text) and [`assertThat(locator).hasText()`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/test-assertions#locator-assertions-to-have-text) now accept `ignoreCase` option.\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n* If there's a service worker that's in your way, you can now easily disable it with a new context option `serviceWorkers`:\r\n  ```java\r\n  BrowserContext context = browser.newContext(new Browser.NewContextOptions()\r\n      .setServiceWorkers(ServiceWorkerPolicy.BLOCK));\r\n  ```\r\n* Using `.zip` path for `recordHar` context option automatically zips the resulting HAR:\r\n  ```java\r\n  BrowserContext context = browser.newContext(new Browser.NewContextOptions()\r\n      .setRecordHarPath(Paths.get(\"example.har.zip\")));\r\n  ```\r\n* If you intend to edit HAR by hand, consider using the `\"minimal\"` HAR recording mode\r\n  that only records information that is essential for replaying:\r\n  ```java\r\n  BrowserContext context = browser.newContext(new Browser.NewContextOptions()\r\n      .setRecordHarPath(Paths.get(\"example.har.zip\"))\r\n      .setRecordHarMode(HarMode.MINIMAL));\r\n  ```\r\n* Playwright now runs on Ubuntu 22 amd64 and Ubuntu 22 arm64.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright-java/releases/70760987/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 3, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

Frame locators capture the logic sufficient to retrieve the `iframe` and then locate elements in that iframe. Frame locators are strict by default, will wait for `iframe` to appear and can be used in Web-First assertions.\r\n\r\n![Graphics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/142082759-2170db38-370d-43ec-8d41-5f9941f57d83.png)\r\n\r\nFrame locators can be created with either [`page.FrameLocator(selector)`] or [`locator.FrameLocator(selector)`] method.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nLocator locator = page.frameLocator(\"#my-frame\").locator(\"text=Submit\");\r\nlocator.click();\r\n```\r\n\r\nRead more at [our documentation](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-framelocator).\r\n\r\n## Trace Viewer Update\r\n\r\nPlaywright Trace Viewer is now **available online** at https://trace.playwright.dev! Just drag-and-drop your `trace.zip` file to inspect its contents.\r\n\r\n> **NOTE**: trace files are not uploaded anywhere; [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev) is a [progressive web application](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) that processes traces locally.\r\n\r\n- Trace Viewer now shows test name\r\n- New trace metadata tab with browser details\r\n- Snapshots now have URL bar\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/141877831-29e37cd1-e574-4bd9-aab5-b13a463bb4ae.png)\r\n\r\n## Ubuntu ARM64 support + more\r\n\r\n- Playwright now supports **Ubuntu 20.04 ARM64**. You can now run Playwright tests inside Docker on Apple M1 and on Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\n\r\n## New APIs\r\n\r\n- Tracing now supports a [`'title'`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-start-option-title) option\r\n- Page navigations support a new [`'commit'`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-page#page-goto) waiting option\r\n\r\n## Browser Versions\r\n\r\n- Chromium 98.0.4695.0\r\n- Mozilla Firefox 94.0.1\r\n- WebKit 15.4\r\n\r\nThis version was also tested against the following stable channels:\r\n\r\n- Google Chrome 96\r\n- Microsoft Edge 96\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[frame locators]: https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-framelocator\r\n[`page.FrameLocator(selector)`]: https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-page#page-frame-locator\r\n[`locator.FrameLocator(selector)`]: https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-locator#locator-frame-locator", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright-java/releases/53677431/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 2, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

It has guides, sample snippets, API docs.\r\n- [Playwright Inspector](https://playwright.dev/docs/inspector) is a **new GUI tool** to author and debug your tests.\r\n  - **Line-by-line debugging** of your Playwright scripts, with play, pause and step-through. Set `PLAYWRIGHT_JAVA_SRC=<src dir>` to let debugger know location of your java sources.\r\n  - Author new scripts by **recording user actions**.\r\n  - **Generate element selectors** for your script by hovering over elements.\r\n  - Set the `PWDEBUG=1` environment variable to launch the Inspector\r\n\r\n- **Pause script execution** with [`page.pause()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#pagepause) in headed mode. Pausing the page launches [Playwright Inspector](https://playwright.dev/docs/inspector) for debugging.\r\n\r\n- **New has-text pseudo-class** for CSS selectors. `:has-text(\"example\")` matches any element containing `\"example\"` somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. See [more examples](https://playwright.dev/docs/selectors#text-selector).\r\n\r\n- **Page dialogs are now auto-dismissed** during execution, unless a listener for `dialog` event is configured.
