The API of the libraries has not changed for over a year now, and they are expected to remain stable.

This used to be in the doxygen documentation, but I preferred to have Markdown versions available on-line (i.e. not requiring compilation with doxygen)\r\n* There is a new tutorial and code in demo_robot/. This illustrates all the steps involved in training and optimizing a DMP on a real-robot. The code in this demo uses C++ for the dmp code (to make it real-time), and Python for the bbo/dmp_bbo code (for on-the-fly plotting of intermediate results), which is the preferred way when running dmpbbo on a real robot.\r\n* Renamed dmpbbo/demos/ to dmpbbo/demos_cpp/. Now demos_cpp/ only contains C++ code (and Python wrappers) and demos_python/ only contains Python code. demo_robot/ now has C++ for the dmp code, and Python for the bbo/dmp_bbo code, as mentioned above. \r\n* Tests executables are no longer installed in bin_test/ to avoid confusion. See the discussion in #39.\r\n* Added the TaskViapointArm2D, as this is used in several scientific papers.\r\n* Added DmpWithGainSchedules class, where gain schedules can be trained and optimized.\r\n* Overhaul of boost::serialization (removed it from src/bbo and src/dmp_bbo because simply too tricky to make it work...)\r\n* Minor bugfixes\r\n* Minor improvements in the doxygen documentation\r\n\r\nThis is the release that was reviewed for the Journal of Open Source Software: https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/1225"}
