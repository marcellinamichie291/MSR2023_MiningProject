It is accompanied by the introduction of a new module `edgedb.codegen` which can be executed to generate code from `.edgeql` files.\r\n\r\n# Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n## Query Result Type Changes\r\n\r\n#366\r\n\r\n1. In edgedb-python 1.0, we dropped many custom data structure implementations, and replaced them with Python builtins:\r\n\r\n   | Impl Dropped   | Replacement | Breaking Changes                                                                                                                                         |\r\n   |----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n   | `edgedb.Tuple` | `tuple`     | `weakref.ref()` will stop working on tuples                                                                                                              |\r\n   | `edgedb.Set`   | `list`      | * Immutability is broken<br>* `weakref.ref()` will stop working on sets<br>* `hash()` will stop working on sets<br>* `repr()` produces different results |\r\n   | `edgedb.Array` | `list`      | * Immutability is broken<br>* `weakref.ref()` will stop working on lists<br>* `hash()` will stop working on lists                                        |\r\n\r\n   While the implementations are dropped, the reference name is still there, like `edgedb.Tuple` is simply an alias of the builtin `tuple`.\r\n\r\n2. `edgedb.NamedTuple` is reimplemented.\r\n\r\n   * **[Breaking Change]** `weakref.ref()` will stop working on named tuples.\r\n   * `edgedb.NamedTuple` is now a subclass of Python builtin `tuple`.\r\n   * Before named tuple instances are created, a transient heap type `DerivedNamedTuple` will be created first as a subclass of `edgedb.NamedTuple`, which is then used to create instances with naming data.\r\n   * `DerivedNamedTuple` classes are usually cached in codecs, and garbage-collected when all its references are cleared.\r\n\r\n3. `edgedb.EnumValue` is reimplemented.\r\n\r\n   * **[Breaking Change]** The result of `repr()` is slightly changed to have the `edgedb.` prefix.\r\n   * `edgedb.EnumValue` is now a subclass of Python builtin `enum.Enum`.\r\n   * Before enum values are created, a transient heap type `DerivedEnumValue` will be created first as a subclass of `edgedb.EnumValue`, which is then used to create instances with full enumeration. Enum member names are simply upper case strings of corresponding values.\r\n   *  `DerivedEnumValue` classes are usually cached in codecs, and garbage-collected when all its references are cleared.\r\n\r\n4. `edgedb.Object` changes.\r\n\r\n   * **[Breaking Change]** The custom implementation of `__hash__()` on `edgedb.Object` is dropped, now `hash()` simply returns a hash on the memory address.\r\n   * **[Breaking Change]** The custom implementation of rich comparion is dropped, that means `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` will stop working on `edgedb.Object` instances, and `==` is now equivalent to `is` for `edgedb.Object` instances.\r\n   * `edgedb.Object` instances will now yield `True` for `dataclasses.is_dataclass()` check.\r\n   * `edgedb.Object` instances can now be used in `dataclasses.as_dict()` to recursively generate a dict containing all properties and links (excluding link properties).\r\n\r\n5. The performance impact is minimal. We are still using the most efficient C-API and C/Cython implementations to offer query results, \r\n\r\n## No more Python 3.6\r\n\r\nAs Python 3.6 is no longer supported itself 10 months ago, edgedb-python is also dropping support for Python 3.6.\r\n\r\nedgedb-python 1.0 now supprots only Pyhton 3.7 to Python 3.11.\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n\r\n## Code generation\r\n\r\n#363\r\n\r\nNow you can create one or more `.edgeql` files in your EdgeDB project directory, and run:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ python -m edgedb.codegen\r\n```\r\n\r\nor alternatively:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ edgedb-py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will search through the EdgeDB project directory and generate typesafe query code for the `.edgeql` files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Access of link properties\r\n\r\n#379 \r\n\r\n`edgedb.Link` and `edgedb.LinkSet` types, as well as the way to access them, are deprecated in edgedb-python 1.0 and will be dropped in 2.0. For example, with a given schema:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype Person {\r\n    multi link friends -> Person {\r\n        property strength -> float32;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpression like `person[\"friends\"]` will now emit a `DeprecationWarning`. This deprecates the old way to access link properties like `person[\"friends\"][0].strength`. Instead, a new way is introduced: you should now use `person.friends[0][\"@strength\"]`.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Detail Changelog\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Implement dataclass for EdgeObject (#359) (by @fantix in dfb8c8b0 for #359)\r\n\r\n* Redo edgedb basic types to inherit from builtin types (#366) (by @fantix in b11b9917 for #366)\r\n\r\n* Officially drop 3.6 support (#373) (by @msullivan in 7b76bc73 for #373)\r\n\r\n* Support Python 3.11 (#375) (by @msullivan in 04b0da2a for #375)\r\n\r\n* Codegen with the describe_query() API (#363) (by @fantix in 361221df for #363)\r\n\r\n* Add codegen docs (#380) (by @colinhacks in 23dd42e6 for #380)\r\n\r\n* Use typing_extension.Literal in codegen for Python 3.7 (by @fantix in 6d0d6abc)\r\n\r\n* Add __all__ to edgedb/__init__.py (by @fmoor in d3ef6d93)\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n* Improve duration parsing (by @fmoor in 241c80d8)\r\n\r\n* Tweak wording in query_single() error messages (#369) (by @msullivan in e24bb538 for #369)\r\n\r\n* Fix flake tests on python3.7 (#371) (by @msullivan in 583e1cbd for #371)\r\n\r\n* Don't reject tuple arguments on the client side (#370) (by @msullivan in 09c950fd for #370)\r\n\r\n* Correct edgedb.Client.close() timeout behavior (by @fantix in 33a912c1)\r\n\r\n* Ping first if conn is idle for too long (#365) (by @fantix in 99cf78a0 for #365)\r\n\r\n* Use @-prefixed keys in object codec for link properties (#384) (by @fantix in 68480f92 for #377)\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Deprecate object links and simplify link property access (#379) (by @fantix in 2c5dcc70 for #379)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/edgedb/edgedb-python/releases/80649474/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 2, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 2, "eyes": 0}, "mentions_count": 4}
