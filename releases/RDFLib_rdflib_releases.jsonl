Closed [issue\r\n  #1423](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/1423), [PR\r\n  #1436](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1436).\r\n- Removed the following functions that were marked as deprecated and scheduled\r\n  for removal in version 6.0.0: `Graph.load`, `Graph.seq`, `Graph.comment`,\r\n  `Graph.label`. [PR #1527](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1527).\r\n- Use `functools.total_ordering` to implement most comparison operations for\r\n  `rdflib.paths.Path`. Closed [issue\r\n  #685](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/685), [PR\r\n  #1528](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1528).\r\n- Fixed error handling for invalid URIs.

Also remove corresponding `check_context`, `check_subject`,\r\n  `check_predicate`, `check_object`, `check_statement`, `check_pattern` that is\r\n  unused. [PR #1640](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1640).\r\n- Improved the population of the `Accept` HTTP header so that it is correctly\r\n  populated for all formats. [PR\r\n  #1643](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1643).\r\n- Fixed some issues with SPARQL Algebra handling/translation.

The time it\r\n  takes for these parsers to parse strings with escape sequences will be\r\n  increased, and the increase will be correlated with the amount of escape\r\n  sequences that occur in a string. For strings with many escape sequences the\r\n  parsing speed seems to be almost 4 times slower. Closed [issue\r\n  #1655](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/1655), [PR\r\n  #1663](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1663).\r\n  - Also marked `rdflib.compat.decodeStringEscape` as deprecated as this\r\n    function is not used anywhere in RDFLib anymore and the utility that it does\r\n    provide is not implemented correctly. It will be removed in RDFLib 7.0.0\r\n- Added an abstract class `IdentifiedNode` as a superclass of `BNode` and\r\n  `URIRef`. Closed [issue #1526](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/1526),\r\n  [PR #1680](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1680).\r\n- Fixed turtle serialization of `rdf:type` in subject, object.

Closed [issue\r\n  #1661](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/1661), [PR\r\n  #1678](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1678).\r\n- Added support for selecting which namespace prefixes to bind. Closed [issue\r\n  #1679](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/1679) and [issue #1880](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1880), [PR\r\n  #1686](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1686), [PR\r\n  #1845](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1845) and [PR\r\n    #2018](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/2018).\r\n  - Also added `ConjunctiveGraph.get_graph`.\r\n  - Also added an `override` argument to `Store.bind` which behaves similarly to\r\n    the `override` parameter for `NamespaceManager.bind`.\r\n  - Also fixed handing of support of the `override` parameter to\r\n    `NamespaceManager.bind` by passing.\r\n- Eliminated a `DeprecationWarning` related to plugin loading [issue\r\n  #1631](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/1631), [PR\r\n  #1694](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1694).\r\n- Removed the `rdflib.graph.ContextNode` and `rdflib.graph.DatasetQuad` type\r\n  aliases. These were not being widely used in RDFLib and were also not correct.\r\n  [PR #1695](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1695).\r\n- Added `DefinedNamespace.as_jsonld_context`. [PR\r\n  #1706](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1706).\r\n- Added `rdflib.namespace.WGS` for WGS84. Closed [issue\r\n  #1709](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/1709),  [PR\r\n  #1710](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1710).\r\n- Improved performance of `DefinedNamespace` by caching attribute values. [PR\r\n  #1718](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1718).\r\n- Only configure python logging if `sys.stderr` has a `isatty` attribute. Closed\r\n  [issue #1760](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/1760), [PR\r\n  #1761](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1761).\r\n- Removed unused `rdflib.compat.etree_register_namespace`. [PR\r\n  #1768](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1768).\r\n- Fixed numeric shortcut handling in `rdflib.util.from_n3`. Closed [issue\r\n  #1769](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/1769), [PR\r\n  #1771](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1771).\r\n- Add ability to detect and mark ill-typed literals. Closed [issue\r\n  #1757](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/1757) and [issue\r\n  #848](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/848), [PR\r\n  #1773](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1773) and [PR\r\n  #2003](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/2003).\r\n- Optimized `NamespaceManager.compute_qname` by caching validity. [PR\r\n  #1779](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1779).\r\n- SPARQL: Fixed the handling of `EXISTS` inside `BIND` for SPARQL. This was\r\n  raising an exception during evaluation before but is now correctly handled.\r\n  Closed [issue #1472](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/1472), [PR\r\n  #1794](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1794).\r\n- Propagate exceptions from SPARQL TSV result parser.
