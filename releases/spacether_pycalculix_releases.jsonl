Calculix or GMSH.\nWebsite: http://justinablack.com/pycalculix/\nSource Code: https://github.com/spacether/pycalculix\nThis file includes binaries (programs): Gmsh (meshing), and Calculix (FEA solver).\nIt works on Linux and Windows.\n\nWindows Installation:\nThis release is a python installation file.\nOne must have python 3+ installed, and the pip library.\nTo install it, in your console, type:\npip install pycalculix\nor manually download this file and type:\npip install Drive:/folder/pycalculix-0.9.3.zip  [you insert the location that you downloaded the zip file to]\n\nLinux Linux:\nCalculix binaries removed from pycalculix.\nSee installation instructions at: https://github.com/spacether/pycalculix\nCalculix must be installed separately.\n\npycalculix Features:\n-Static structural models can be made and analyzed\n-Triangular or quadratic first or second order elements\n-Plane stress, plane strain, and axisymmetric elements\n-Loads: pressure, forces, water pressure, rotational speed, gravity\n-Constraints: displacement constraints\n-All results can be plotted and queried from python\n-CAD import from dxf files\n-Single or multiple parts with contact\n\nSingle parts can be analyzed or\nMultiple parts with contact between them\n    See example files: pipe-crush-elastic.py, pinned-plate.py\n\n0.9.3\n    ADDED: Import CAD geometry from dxf file\n        See pycalculix.CadImporter\n    ADDED: multiple parts with contacts\n        See example files: pipe-crush-elastic.py, pinned-plate.py\n    ADDED: Element results plotting added\n        Element results plotting:   pycalculix.Problem.rfile.eplot()\n        Nodal results plotting:     pycalculix.Problem.rfile.nplot()\n        Number Formatting:\n            Strain results now use scientific formatting\n            Others use nearest 10**3 suffixes\n        Max and min values now listed above the colorbar\n    ADDED: method to draw an arc by swept angle in degrees\n        part.draw_arc_angle(degrees_ccw, center_x, center_y)\n    ADDED: min_val and max_val can now be passed to eplot and nplot\n        This lets the user set the results range that they want to see:\n        min_val <= colored results <= max_val\n        Values under and over are greyed out, darker under, lighter over\n    ADDED: internal holes in parts\n        One can make circular holes, or draw complicated holes.\n        See example 7\n    ADDED: Added set_ediv method to FeaModel class.\n        This method sets the number of elements on a line.\n        line.set_ediv still works.\n    ADDED: Robust selection object: feamodel.view\n        This object is feamodel.view Most important methods are:\n        view.select_all, view.select, view.allsel_under\n        All plotting now uses the current selection set\n    SYNTAX: updated how parts, materials, problems are made\n        Make part: \n            pycalculix.FeaModel.make_part or pycalculix.Part  \n        Make material:\n            pycalculix.FeaModel.make_matl or pycalculix.Material  \n        Make problem (previously called model):\n            pycalculix.FeaModel.make_problem or pycalculix.Problem\n        Make Results File:\n            pycalculix.Problem.rfile or pycalculix.ResultsFile(problem)\n"}
