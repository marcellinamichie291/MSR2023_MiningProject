Mathematica and Python code were put into package formats.\r\n\r\n2. The \"MRlib.{tex,pdf}\" user manual was modified.\r\n\r\n3. A \"README.md\" file describing installation and usage was added for each programming language.  \r\n\r\n4. Six functions were added, measuring the distance of a matrix to SO(3) and SE(3), projecting matrices to SO(3) and SE(3), and testing if matrices are in SO(3) and SE(3).  \r\n\r\n## MATLAB ##\r\n\r\n1. The code folder name was changed to \"mr\", which can be used as a library.\r\n\r\n2. Users can see a function's description and example usage using `help FunctionName`\r\n\r\n## Python ##\r\n\r\n1. The code was rearranged to fit the package format.  \r\n\r\n2. Users can see a function's description and example usage using `help(mr.FunctionName)` (assuming the code package was imported as \"mr\").\r\n\r\n3. All functions now use numpy.array for matrix and vector inputs and outputs.\r\n\r\n4. matplotlib was made an optional dependency.\r\n\r\n5. Formerly, some functions incorrectly used integer math if all the inputs were integers.  This has been fixed.\r\n\r\n## Mathematica ##\r\n\r\n1. The code was changed from a notebook (.nb) to a package (.m).\r\n\r\n2. Functions were rewritten to fit the syntax of a Mathematica package.\r\n\r\n3. The code and its usage were separated as required by packaging.\r\n\r\n4. Users can see a function's description and example usage using `?FunctionName`."}
