Among the new features are:\n- new testing schema that helps to minimize bugs\n- full Windows support\n- full Python2 support\n\nIn addition to earler versions in which we added a verbose-flag that allows the user to switch to verbose and debug output during a session, we now added a semi-verbose output which creates a dynamic progress bar when using time-consuming operations (alignments or cognate detection). This behaviour is loaded as a default. You can switch it off by typing:\n\n``` python\n>>> rc(progressbar=False)\n```\n\nor\n\n``` python\n>>> rc(semi_verbose=False)\n```\n\nIn most cases, however, it will probably be useful to know that LingPy is currently working.\n"}
