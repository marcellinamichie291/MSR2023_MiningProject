You must now have WiringPi installed on your target Raspberry Pi system separately from Pi4J. WiringPi is now included be default in the latest Raspbian builds. We made this change in part because the WiringPi project now requests no static linking and because it would cause Pi4J to fail on newer platforms when we were not able to get a new build released in a reasonable and timely manner. This change should be of a minimal negative impact now that WiringPi is included with the OS and users will benefit from being able to take advantage of newer WiringPi builds without depending on a new Pi4J build.\r\n\r\nOn the Raspberry Pi Model 3B the hardware-based serial/UART device /dev/ttyAMA0 has been re-purposed to communicate with the the built-in Bluetooth modem and is no longer mapped to the serial RX/TX pins on the GPIO header. Instead, a new serial port \"/dev/ttyS0\" has been provided which is implemented with a software-based UART (miniUART). This software-based UART (\"/dev/ttyS0\") does not support PARITY and some have experienced some stability issues using this port at higher speeds. If you don't need the Bluetooth modem functionality, you can disable the BT modem and configure the RPi to use a device-tree overlay to re-map the hardware-based serial UART (\"/dev/ttyAMA0\") back to the GPIO header pins for TX/RX. See the instructions on this page for details on how to configure the device-tree overlay and disable the bluetooth modem/service: https://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/12311\r\n\r\nThe Odroid C1/C1+/C2 only permits up to four GPIO pins to be configured with edge detection for both \"rising\" and \"falling\" edges (a.k.a., \"both\"). Thus, you can only use a maximum of four GPIO input pins with listener events. You can, however, implement a polling strategy to read a pin state if you need more than 4 input pins. (see: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/issues/229 & http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:c1_hardware_irq)\r\n\r\nPWM is not supported in the Hardkernel Odroid WiringPi port. Thus PWM is not currently supported by Pi4J for the Odroid boards (C1/C1+/C2). There is no PWM function on the 30pin GPIO header on the XU3/XU4.\r\n(see: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/issues/229)\r\n\r\nSupport for OrangePi and Synovoip BPI platforms is considered experimental and has had limited testing. Not all Pi4J features may be supported and/or working properly.\r\n"}
