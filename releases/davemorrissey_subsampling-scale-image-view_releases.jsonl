This can be disabled with `setEagerLoadingEnabled(false)`\r\n* Added experimental class `SkiaPooledImageRegionDecoder` which maintains a small pool of `BitmapRegionDecoder` instances to allow for parallel decoding when combined with a multi-threaded executor."}

The difference in quality is usually unnoticeable, especially with photos. Use `setMinimumTileDpi(int)` to override the default.\r\n* #273 #295 Added minimum scale type `SCALE_TYPE_START`. This displays the image filling the view width and height, and scrolled to the top left.\r\n* #284 Double tap is now always interpreted as zoom when zoomed out, to avoid problems when minimum and maximum scale are very close.\r\n* #298 Added `getPanRemaining(RectF)`, which exposes the pan remaining in each direction, in screen pixels.\r\n* #329 Allow `OnClickListener` to work before the image has loaded.\r\n* #331 Added methods to convert view coordinates to source file coordinates to enable the visible area to be extracted from the source image. `visibleFileRect(Rect)` and `viewToFileRect(Rect, Rect)`.\r\n* #344 Guard against null `vFocusStart` in animation.\r\n* Improved debug overlay."}

Migrating activities and subclasses to the new version is simple, please see the notes in the README.**\n- Combined `ScaleImageView` and `SubsamplingScaleImageView` into one class. Tiling can be enabled or disabled as appropriate. `SubsamplingScaleImageView` can now display a bitmap.\n- Refactored ready events. When `onReady` is called, the view is ready to display an image (in previous versions this only indicated the source dimensions were known).\n- Simplified method of specifying the source image, reducing the proliferation of `setImage...` methods.\n- #37 Allow use of a preview image from resources, assets, filesystem or bitmap to enable gestures while a large full size image is loading.\n- #46 Display a specified region of the source file.\n- #40 Listener interface can be used to receive load errors and ready events.\n- #41 No objects allocated in `onDraw` or `onTouchEvent` to improve efficiency.\n- Fixed a bug with tile sizes that resulted in the last few pixels of some images being cropped.\n- Fixed a bug with double tap zoom not respecting disabled pan.\n- Fixed incorrect requested centre point after size change.\n"}
