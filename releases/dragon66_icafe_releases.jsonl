It all came out of personal interest and had no intention to make it public. One of the reason is my personality. I don't like to be tied into something which may want your attention when you are not in the mood to be on it - a pull not a push operation.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, for other reasons such as a place to keep my work from lost, I finally put this one on GIT and I am glad I did that while looking back.\r\n\r\nEver since I published the snapshot, users for this library have been asking me to have a public release instead. As kind of perfectionist, I am still not so pleased about a few things that I haven't been able to finish but believed I would be for this library. But after the past few years, due to outside and inside factors including health related issues, I don't see I can get the wish list items done in a near future or even possible to get them done.\r\n\r\nFor all these, I am releasing this library in its current status as v0.0. Hope this will make it easier for users."}
