Often a peer would have a backlog of get_header requests, so would then send many identical headers messages before catching up to the new get_headers, which has now had the same problem.\n\nImproved debug logging. Logging regarding --debug now provides concise message summaries for protocol traffic and shows invalid block information.\n\nBug fixes for logging and switching blockchain branches when building on orphans.\n\nThis is version 0.0.3 on pypi.\n"}
