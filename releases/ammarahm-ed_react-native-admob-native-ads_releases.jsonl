All possible only due to help from  @yaroslavnikiforov providing me with the necessary facebook ad accounts for testing\r\n- **Ad targeting**\r\n Full support to show targeted ads. Check the docs for details\r\n- **Video Controls and Events**\r\nBasic video controls and events for play, pause, end etc are added too\r\n- **Rewrite documentation and publish on GH-Pages**\r\n The most frustrating job to do but always worth it. Check the new docs and help me improve it, I will accept pull requests\r\n- **Improve CallToActionView**\r\nPreviously CallToActionView was not clickable properly. Now we support proper clicking and interaction.\r\n- **Many under the hood bug fixes and improvements.**\r\nSeveral things have been changed under the hood which will result in better ads and low memory usage.\r\n \r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\nWith so many things changing there are definately some breaking changes but nothing huge.\r\n\r\n1. `MediaView` is renamed to `NativeMediaView`\r\n2. Ads are not loaded automatically. You need to use `ref` to load ads. Check docs for details.\r\n3. `refreshInterval` & `delayAdLoading` props have been removed\r\n4. You need to use `buttonAndroidStyle` to style the `CallToActionView` on Android\r\n\r\n### Head over to [Migrating Guide](https://ammarahm-ed.github.io/react-native-admob-native-ads/docs/migrating/) to see what you need to change.\r\n"}

Fix NPM dependencies by using peerDependencies, now you have to manually add all the dependancies of the library @mrousavy Fixed #55 \r\n3. Use a partial implementation for ImageProps. @Nox04 \r\n4. Fix rendering of multiple ads in a FlatList. #51  \r\n5. Try to reload ad when it fails to load after the specified refreshInterval\r\n6. Fix CallToActionView assigned on AdvertiserView on Android. #57\r\n7. Hide the Ad when it is loading by default so it does not show empty components. \r\n8. Refactor and cleanup the code.\r\n\r\n## What's New \r\n\r\n1. Rewrite the Root `NativeAdView` component as a Class Component\r\n2. Use callable module on Android to receive `onUnifiedNativeAdLoaded` event so ad renders in its correct view using a unique ID.\r\n3. Rewrite the example to demonstrate Banner Ad, Video/Image Ad & Ads in a List properly. \r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n1. You need to add `react-native-star-rating` as a direct dependency of the main project from now onwards. \r\n\r\n"}
