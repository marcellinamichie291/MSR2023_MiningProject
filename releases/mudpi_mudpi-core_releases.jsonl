Every system has been refactored and better incorporated into a more cohesive system. Many items have been organized in a new extension system to keep updates more manageable with a growing number of additions (from multiple contributors). In this update I really took a long time to think about a foundation for MudPi to sit on going forward. This would then lend to a more stable core without the need for as many breaking changes. Much of the old main file has have been refactored into core systems. With this update providing a more solid framework I can continue to work on more supporting resources and content. Previously with each major breaking change it would require time consuming revisions across multiple areas. I am excited for these changes and what it enables me to work on next. The documentation has already been updated to reflect this version. \r\n\r\n- Complete refactor of all systems\r\n- Created a `MudPi` class to centrally store data for all components\r\n- MudPi is now a python package and runs like standard pacakge\r\n- Configurations\r\n\t- Added `Config` class to handle configurations\r\n\t- Added YAML support\r\n\t- Allowed any filename for configurations\r\n\t- Added ability to convert JSON to YAML configs\r\n\t- Added feature to create default config\r\n- Events\r\n\t- Overhauled the event system to a event manager\r\n\t- Consolidated events across the system to better groupings\r\n\t- Added adapters for event system to run on. \r\n\t\t- Added `redis` adapter for redis support\r\n\t\t- Added `mqtt` adapter for mqtt support\r\n\t- Core events can now run on multiple channels at once\r\n\t- Changed events to be more uniform in format\r\n- Extensions\r\n\t- Added an extension system to dynamically load systems with components\r\n\t- Converted all existing components into appropriate extensions\r\n\t- Extensions dynamically load based on config files and install requirements as needed\r\n\t- Custom extensions can load from `custom_extensions` folder\r\n- State\r\n\t- State is now handled by an internal state manager\r\n\t- Now stored with better data such as timestamps\r\n\t- State is backed up in `redis` and restored on restart\r\n- Actions\r\n\t- Made actions available for all components for better control\r\n\t- Actions can be called via triggers or events\r\n\t- Added `action` extension for to allow custom actions from configs\r\n\t- Components expose standard actions (i.e. toggle automatically adds 'turn_on' action)\r\n- Sensors\r\n\t- Added `sensor` extension for existing sensor logic\r\n\t- Migrated old sensors into new components\r\n\t- Split sensors into more appropriate groupings\r\n\t- Added Support for `redis` sensor\r\n\t- Added support for `mqtt` sensor\r\n\t- Sensors have a `force_update` action to

for existing trigger logic\r\n\t- Migrated over old triggers into new components and interfaces\r\n\t- Updated trigger groups to be an actual trigger class\r\n\t- Triggers can now be solo and part of a group\r\n\t- Triggers can be part of multiple groups\r\n\t- Triggers now just call `actions`\r\n\t- Updated threshold checks for better error handling\r\n\t- Thresholds now allow formatting and type casting through `type` and `format`\r\n\t- Add `before`, `after` and `between` trigger types for **datetime** comparisons\r\n\t- Add `sun` triggers that check time against sun data\r\n- Automation Sequences\r\n\t- Added `sequence` extension for existing sequence logic\r\n\t- Migrated over old sequence to new components\r\n\t- Added actions for interaction instead of manually linking them to
