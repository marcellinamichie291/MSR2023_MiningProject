It is planned to be the last release before version 1.0.0 where we expect to land a number of exciting new features.\r\n\r\nWhat follows are the **highlights** of the release. For a more detailed list of all changes, please refer to [the release notes in the documentation](http://odlgroup.github.io/odl/release_notes.html#odl-0-7-0-release-notes-2018-09-09).\r\n\r\n## Native multi-indexing of ODL space elements\r\n\r\nThe `DiscreteLpElement` and `Tensor` (renamed from `FnBaseVector`) data structures now natively support almost all kinds of Numpy \"fancy\" indexing. \r\nAt the same time, the spaces `DiscreteLp` and `Tensorspace` (renamed from `FnBase`) have more advanced indexing capabilities as well. Up to few exceptions, `elem[indices] in space[indices]` is always fulfilled.\r\nAlongside, `ProductSpace` and its elements also support more advanced indexing, in particular in the case of power spaces.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, integration with Numpy has been further improved with the implementation of the `__array_ufunc__` interface. This allows to transparently use ODL objects in calls to Numpy UFuncs, e.g., `np.cos(odl_obj, out=odl_obj)` or `np.add.reduce(odl_in, axis=0, out=odl_out)` \u2014 both these examples were not possible with the `__array__` and `__array_wrap__` interfaces.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this changeset makes the `odlcuda` plugin unusable since it only supports linear indexing. A much more powerful replacement based on CuPy will be added in version 1.0.0.\r\n\r\n## Integration with deep learning frameworks\r\n\r\nODL is now integrated with three major deep learning frameworks: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Theano](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/). In particular, ODL `Operator` and `Functional` objects can be used as layers in neural networks, with support for automatic differentiation and backpropagation. This makes a lot of (inverse) problems that ODL can handle well, e.g., tomography, accessible to the computation engines of the deep learning field, and opens up a wide range of possibilities to combine the two.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this functionality and examples of its usage can be found in the packages [`tensorflow`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib/tensorflow), [`torch`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib/torch) and [`theano`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib/theano) in the `odl.contrib` sub-package (see below).\r\n\r\n## New `contrib` sub-package\r\n\r\nThe core ODL library is intended to stay focused on general-purpose classes and data structures, and good code quality is a major goal. This implies that contributions need to undergo scrutiny in a review process, and that some contributions might not be a good fit if they are too specific for certain applications.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, we have created a new [`contrib`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib) sub-package that is intended for exactly this kind of code. As of writing this, `contrib` already contains a number of highly useful modules:\r\n\r\n- [`datasets`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib/datasets): Loaders and utility code for publicly available datasets (currently FIPS CT, Mayo clinic human CT, Tu Graz MRI and some image data)\r\n- [`fom`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib/fom): Implementations of Figures-of-Merit for image quality assessment\r\n- [`mrc`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib/mrc): Reader and writer for the MRC 2014 data format in electron microscopy\r\n- [`param_opt`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib/param_opt): Optimization strategies for method hyperparameters\r\n- [`pyshearlab`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib/pyshearlab): Integration of the [`pyshearlab`](https://github.com/stefanloock/pyshearlab) Python library for shearlet decomposition and analysis\r\n- [`shearlab`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib/shearlab): Integration of the [`Shearlab.jl`](https://github.com/arsenal9971/Shearlab.jl) Julia shearlet library\r\n- [`solvers`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib/solvers): More exotic functionals and optimization methods than in the core ODL library\r\n- [`tomo`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib/tomo): Vendor- or application-specific geometries (currently Elekta ICON and XIV)\r\n- [`tensorflow`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib/tensorflow): Integration of ODL with TensorFlow\r\n- [`theano`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib/theano): Integration of ODL with Theano\r\n- [`torch`](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/odl/contrib/torch): Integration of ODL with PyTorch\r\n\r\n## Overhaul of tomographic geometries\r\n\r\nThe classes for representing tomographic geometries in `odl.tomo` have undergone a major update, resulting in a consistent definition of coordinate systems across all cases, [proper documentation](https://odlgroup.github.io/odl/guide/geometry_guide.html), vectorization and broadcasting semantics in all methods that compute vectors, and significant speed-up of backprojection due to better axis handling.\r\nAdditionally, factory functions `cone_beam_geometry` and `helical_geometry` have been added as a simpler and more accessible way to create cone beam geometries.\r\n"}

It has instead been moved to a separate library, [odlcuda](https://github.com/odlgroup/odlcuda).\n\n## New features\n- To enable cuda backends for the odl spaces, an entry point `'odl.space'` has been added where external libraries can hook in to add `FnBase` and `NtuplesBase` type spaces.\n- Add pytest fixtures `'fn_impl'` and `'ntuple_impl'` to the test config `conf.py`. These can now be accessed from any test.\n- Allow creation of general spaces using the `fn`, `cn` and `rn` methods. This functions now take an `impl` parameter which defaults to `'numpy'` but with odlcuda installed it may also be set to `'cuda'`. The old numpy specific `Fn`, `Cn` and `Rn` functions have been removed.\n\n## Changes\n- Moved all CUDA specfic code out of the library into odlcuda. This means that `cu_ntuples.py` and related files have been removed.\n- rename `ntuples.py` to `npy_ntuples.py`.\n- Added `Numpy` to the numy based spaces. They are now named `NumpyFn` and `NumpyNtuples`.\n- Prepended `npy_` to all methods specific to `ntuples` such as weightings.\n"}
