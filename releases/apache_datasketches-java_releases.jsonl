Where a null is harmless, it is ignored. However, receiving an empty sketch is considered valid, and the result follows the set operation logic.\r\n\r\n| Operation                     | Null Policy | Empty Policy |\r\n|:-----------------------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|\r\n| Union                         | Ignored     | Ignored      |\r\n| Intersection                  | Exception   | Empty result |\r\n| AnotB, first Argument, A      | Exception   | Empty result |\r\n| AnotB, subsequent Argument, B | Ignored     | Ignored      |\r\n\r\n### Improved Set Operation handling\r\n\r\n#### In Theta Sketch and Tuple Sketch (Generic), the APIs for Union, AnotB and Intersection now allow for both stateless and stateful operation.\r\n* see [ExamplesTest.java](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-java/blob/master/src/test/java/org/apache/datasketches/theta/ExamplesTest.java) for full example code\r\n\r\n* Pseudocode model for stateless operation. \r\nTwo set operation arguments and the result are accomplished in one call:  \r\n`result = setOp(Sketch A, Sketch B);`  \r\nwhere `setOp` = `union`, `intersect`, or `aNotB`\r\n \r\n* Pseudocode model for stateful operation. Any number of arguments can be presented sequentially:   \r\n`void setOp(Sketch 1);`  \r\n`void setOp(Sketch 2);`  \r\n`...`  \r\n`void setOp(Sketch N);`  \r\n`result = getResult();`  \r\nWhere `setOp = union` or `intersect`  \r\nBecause the AnotB operation is asymmetric, the method names are a little different:  \r\n`void setA(Sketch 1);` //for the first argument  \r\n`void notB(Sketch 2);` //for all subsequent arguments  \r\n`...`  \r\n`void notB(Sketch N);`\r\n`result = getResult();`\r\n\r\n#### Tuple Sketch (Generic) set operations now allow combining with Theta Sketch\r\n* Pseudocode model for stateless operation:  \r\n`result = setOp(TupleSketch A, ThetaSketch B);`  \r\n\r\n* Pseudocode model for stateful operation:  \r\n`void setOp(TupleSketch 1);`  \r\n`void setOp(ThetaSketch 1);`  \r\n`void setOp(TupleSketch 2);`  \r\n`...`  \r\n`void setOp(ThetaSketch N);`  \r\n`result = getResult();`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Package changes\r\n* The `tuple` package was too large and confusing. The ArrayOfDoubles classes, generic base classes and example generic classes were all mingled together.

This totally replaces the freeMemory() requirements of the prior Memory implementation.\r\n  * The API has been streamlined to allow simpler creation of regions (like ByteBuffer slices), which are views of the same underlying resource.  \r\n  * The internal architecture has been redesigned to eliminate redundancy and cleaner separation of the management of resources (off-heap memory, memory-mapped files, wrapped ByteBuffers and wrapped primitive arrays) from the specifics of the API implementation.\r\n  * Currently there are two API implementations: <i>Memory</i>, which provides direct-addressed, primitive (and primitive array) access, and <i>Buffer</i>, which provides a relative positional interface for primitive (and primitive array) access. \r\n  * This has required some API changes when using the Memory package: For example, instead of new NativeMemory(bytes) use Memory.wrap(bytes) or WritableMemory.wrap(bytes). Watch the distinction between the read-only wrap methods, which take Memory and updatable wrap methods, which take WritableMemory. Attempts to modify read-only objects will throw SketchesReadOnlyException.\r\n- Completely rewritten HLL sketches with improved speed and accuracy performance.\r\n  * The prior version of HLL had some performance, usability and design issues that were problematic.  In addition, our science team has developed some more advanced estimators that dramatically improve the accuracy of the HLL sketches, especially in the low-range. We decided that the best route was to redesign the HLL sketches from scratch.  \r\n- Added weighted sampling sketch\r\n  * <tt>VarOptItemsSketch</tt> creates a random sample of <i>weighted</i> items from a stream, with the inclusion probability approximately a function of the item's weight. The sketch can additionally apply a predicate to the sampled items to compute sums of weights over the subset, along with error bounds.\r\n- Added support for subset sums with error bounds to Reservoir sampling\r\n  * Mirrors the (new) functionality for weighted sampling, back-ported to unweighted sampling.\r\n- Some API changes in the Builder.build() methods:\r\n  * Builder.build() methods don't accept sketch size anymore, and optionally only accept a Memory object.  This was changed to avoid an easy-to-create bug by a user that can be difficult to find.  The initMemory(Memory) function is moved to the build(Memory) and the build(int k) function is moved to a builder.setK(int k) function. \r\n- To improve consistency and clarity of functionality across the library, we have changed factory method names from the generic <i>getInstance()</i> to <i>newInstance()</i> when a virgin instance is being created and <i>heapify()</i>, or <i>wrap()</i> when the result instance already contains data."}

The jars for the Memory package will appear as \r\n<i>memory-X.Y.Z-&lt;type&gt;.jar</i>.  \r\n\r\nThe remainder of the library is its own module and will appear as usual as \r\n<i>sketches-core-X.Y.Z-&lt;type&gt;.jar</i>, but with a dependency on the memory jar.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the usual jar types, there is an additional \r\n<i>sketches-core-X.Y.Z-with-shaded-memory.jar</i>, which contains the \r\n<i>sketches-core-X.Y.Z.jar</i> and a shaded, renamed <i>memory-X.Y.Z.jar</i>.  \r\n\r\nThis shading allows protection from the \"DLL Hell\" situation where there may be a different version of the memory jar registered in the same system.\r\n\r\n## New Sampling Package\r\n\r\nWe have now added a <i>sampling</i> package into the suite of different types of sketch algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe first entry in this area is an efficient implementation of the classical reservoir sampling algorithm that is often used as an interview question.  However, this implementation is quite a bit more sophisticated in that it also solves the more complex problem of merging with different sized sketches.  It also includes a base implementation using longs (more as a tutorial example) as well as a Java Generic version that can be extended to any type, including polymorphic types.  As with all the other sketches in the library the challenges of efficient serialization and deserialization have also been addressed.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of exciting ways this sampling package can grow.\r\n\r\n## Memory Package Enhancements\r\n\r\nThe Memory package is used extensively in the library for off-heap work and a number of groups have shown a lot of interest in using it more broadly.  In this release we have extended the API to include read-only variants of the Memory classes in the same way as the ByteBuffer classes.   It also has been extended to allow direct access to the Unsafe class in those situations where the utmost in performance is required.  Examples of the emerging use of this capability can be found in the PreambleUtils class in the quantiles package.  Caution is advised when using this package, as it is easy to \"shoot yourself in the foot\"!  Caveat Emptor!\r\n\r\n## New PairwiseSetOperations\r\n\r\nThe new PairwiseSetOperations class fills in the need for performing set operations on just 2 arguments fast.  These are stateless operations and are specifically optimized for Theta Sketches that are already in ordered, CompactSketch form.\r\n"}

Refer to the Javadocs and code documentation of ArrayOfItemsSerDe.\r\n- Corrected problem of downsampling with quantiles/Union: If you set k to a lower value, it was ignored with the first sketch update with a larger k.\r\n\r\n## All Sketches:\r\n\r\nChanged the leaf-node classes to final.  These classes are not designed to be extended.\r\n\r\n## Static analyzers\r\n- Ran FindBugs, which found a few minor coding issues, which have been corrected. \r\n- Running PMD and Checkstyle found a lot of \"style\" issues.  All of the style issues that I agree with have been corrected. \r\n- The <i>/tools</i> directory has a FindBugsExcludeFilter.xml and a SketchesCheckstyle.xml that you can use to run these static checkers yourself. \r\n- They are not yet integrated into the maven pom.xml. \r\n\r\n## Memory Package\r\n- Added MemoryMappedFile to the Memory package. \r\n- This capability allows mapping a file, which can be larger than 2GB, into native memory and the ability to write any changes back to that file. \r\n- It is similar to, but much simpler than Java's FileChannel.map() function that returns a MappedByteBuffer, which is restricted to files less than 2GB. \r\n- This capability should be considered experimental and is not thread safe.\r\n"}

This is a one-time change that will require users to update their code base to the new names. For example:\r\n- quantiles package:\r\n  - ItemsQuantilesSketch -> ItemsSketch\r\n  - DoublesQuantilesSketch -> DoublesSketch\r\n  - DoublesQuantilesSketchBuilder -> DoublesSketchBuilder\r\n- frequencies package\r\n  - FrequentItemsSketch -> ItemsSketch\r\n  - FrequentLongsSketch -> LongsSketch\r\n\r\nSimilar changes are reflected in the names of the test classes\r\n\r\n### Binary Storage Improvements for quantiles/DoublesSketch\r\n\r\nThe new storage structure is about half the size, on average, so it will be faster and smaller to merge, serialize, deserialize. This is also a one-time change and the new version cannot read the old binary format. Hopefully we have caught this early enough so that users don't have many sketches stored in the previous format.\r\n\r\n### Restructuring\r\n\r\nThe frequencies/ArrayOf&lt;Type&gt;SerDe classes are useful for the generic versions of both FrequentItems and Quantiles sketches and so have been promoted to the sketches package.\r\n\r\n### Javadocs and code formatting\r\n\r\nThis version includes a number of improvements to the javadocs and code to make it easier to read.  This is an ongoing process.\r\n\r\n### External Contributions.  Thank you!\r\n\r\nGeorge Kankava of DevFactory suggested creating dedicated RuntimeException classes for the library.  This has been implemented and will allow systems that implement the library to catch all exceptions thrown by the library classes to be caught as SketchesException.  George also found a few binary OR operations that should have been implemented as Logical ORs.  These have been fixed.\r\n"}
