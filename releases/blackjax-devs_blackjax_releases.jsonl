For instance, to initialize and use a HMC kernel:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport blackjax\r\n\r\nhmc = blackjax.hmc(logprob_fn step_size, inverse_mass_matrix, num_integration_steps)\r\nstate = hmc.init(position)\r\nnew_state, info = hmc.step(rng_key, state)\r\n```\r\n`hmc` is now a namedtuple with a `init` and a `step` function; you only need to pass `logprob_fn` at initialization unlike the previous version. The internals were simplified a lot, and the hierarchy is now more flat. For instance, to use the base HMC kernel directly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport blackjax.mcmc.integrators as integrators\r\nimport blackjax.mcmc.hmc as hmc\r\n\r\nkernel = hmc.kernel(integrators.mclachlan)\r\nstate = hmc.init(position, logprob_fn)\r\nstate, info = kernel(rng_key, state, logprob_fn, step_size, inverse_mass_matrix, num_integration_steps)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe API of the base kernels has also been changed to be more flexible.\r\n\r\n## Performance improvements\r\n\r\nThanks to the work of @zaxtax @junpenglao and @rlouf the performance of the NUTS sampler (especially the warmup) has been greatly improved and is now at least on par with numpyro.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\nNo new algorithm in this release, but important work was done on the API, the internals and the examples.\r\n\r\n* Fix SMC notebook as per issue https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/issues/148 by @AdrienCorenflos in https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/pull/149\r\n* Add a logistic regression example by @gerdm in https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/pull/103\r\n* Update to fold in all trajectory building into a single while_loop by @junpenglao in https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/pull/164\r\n* Update use_with_numpyro.ipynb by @junpenglao in https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/pull/165\r\n* Updated trajectory.py by @Gautam-Hegde in https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/pull/167\r\n* Simplify the user API & create a more general kernel by @rlouf in https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/pull/159\r\n* Make the PyMC example run on version 4 by @rlouf in https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/pull/178\r\n* Moved dual_averaging.py to /adaptation and renamed it to optimizers.py by @Bnux256 in https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/pull/179\r\n* Fix example notebook to use pymc 4 by @zaxtax in https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/pull/180\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @gerdm made their first contribution in https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/pull/103\r\n* @Gautam-Hegde made their first contribution in https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/pull/167\r\n* @Bnux256 made their first contribution in https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/pull/179\r\n* @zaxtax made their first contribution in https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/pull/180\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/compare/0.3.0...0.4.0", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/blackjax-devs/blackjax/releases/63004727/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 3, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "mentions_count": 7}
