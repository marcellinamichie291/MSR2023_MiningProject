It has now been extended to automatically apply to all simple types that implement `java.lang.Comparable`.\n  \n  The list of types that qualify as _simple_ has also been extended. It now looks as follows:\n  - all primitive types (int, short, byte, etc.)\n  - all primitive wrapper types (Integer, Short, Byte, etc.)\n  - enums\n  - subclasses of:\n    - `java.math.BigDecimal`\n    - `java.math.BigInteger`\n    - `java.lang.CharSequence`\n    - `java.util.Calendar`\n    - `java.util.Date`\n  - `java.lang.Class`\n  - `java.net.URI`\n  - `java.net.URL`\n  - `java.util.Locale`\n  - `java.util.UUID`\n  \n  Of course this behaviour can be overriden via configuration API or property annotations.\n  \n  To make comparison via `compareTo` more reliable, from now on `compareTo` will be invoked on the `working` and the `base` object and both will be considered equal if either one of this comparisons returns `true`.\n- **Comparison:** Dates are now compared via compareTo method to workaround the strictness of java.util.Date's equals method, which only returns true  for other java.util.Dates, but not for extending classes like java.sql.Date. [#85]\n- **DiffNode:** Replaced some constructors with factory methods to better express their intentions.\n- **Utilities:** Removed some unused collection utility methods.\n- **Tests:** Migrated many, many more tests from TestNG to Spock.\n- **Tests:** Upgraded to Groovy 2.3 and Spock 1.0.\n"}

The signature of bean property values used to simply be the one of its getters return type. The object differ now does its best to determine the most specific **shared** object type. It does this like so:\n  - If the object types of base and working are the same, the signature of this type will be used for introspection. (1)\n  - If the object types of base and working are different, the signature of their closest shared superclass will be used. (2)\n  - If no shared superclass could be found, it falls back the the declared return type of the objects property getter. (3)\n  \n  The runtime type analysis will not consider shared interfaces, so the only way to diff exclusively against interface signatures, is to cause the type lookup to fall through to (3). Currently I'm not sure if it needs to be possible to force the object differ to always use the declared type. If you think it does or this new behavior causes you any trouble, please let me know.\n"}
