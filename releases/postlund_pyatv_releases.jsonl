The active device listener\r\n  is called if connection is lost.\r\n* A copy is now made of the configuration passed to `pyatv.connect` which\r\n  means a config cannot be modified after connecting anymore\r\n* Experimental support for streaming via HTTP(S) has been added to `stream_file`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n\r\n*Protocol: MRP:*\r\n\r\n```\r\nf6a8973 mrp: Migrate protocol to MessageDispatcher\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Protocol: Companion:*\r\n\r\n```\r\ndd44437 companion: Use XID for message dispatch\r\n825912d companion: Move CompanionAPI to separate module\r\na02b3b9 companion: Do not wait for initial event update\r\n5a765bc companion: Fix button presses for HID buttons\r\nceddc9f companion: Add support for additional commands\r\n8c7ed2f companion: Improve tests for sessions and events\r\n5f0cb39 companion: Support playback control availability\r\nb3d69a7 companion: Events and persistent connection\r\n4b7e832 opack: Handle pointers properly\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Protocol: RAOP:*\r\n\r\n```\r\ncf11b42 raop: Support streaming from HTTP(s)\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Other:*\r\n\r\n```\r\na1a357a core: Add enabled state to services\r\n\r\n8b0c82e env: Fix broken GitPod integration\r\n5eb4152 core: Create copy of config in connect\r\n0227529 docs: Add example connect_with_credentials.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n**All changes:**\r\n\r\n```\r\ncf11b42 raop: Support streaming from HTTP(s)\r\na1a357a core: Add enabled state to services\r\n4b7e832 opack: Handle pointers properly\r\n8b0c82e env: Fix broken GitPod integration\r\nf1a2b79 build(deps): bump types-protobuf from 3.18.1 to 3.18.2 in /requirements\r\n1b18cd3 build(deps): bump mediafile from 0.8.1 to 0.9.0 in /requirements\r\n0c4ced5 build(deps): bump aiohttp from 3.8.0 to 3.8.1 in /requirements\r\ne328417 build(deps): bump black from 21.10b0 to 21.11b1 in /requirements\r\nc4fc994 build(deps): bump zeroconf from 0.36.11 to 0.37.0 in /requirements\r\n9ec3559 build(deps): bump cryptography from 35.0.0 to 36.0.0 in /requirements\r\ne8ae699 build(deps): bump types-protobuf from 3.18.0 to 3.18.1 in /requirements\r\na70609d build(deps): bump pylint from 2.11.1 to 2.12.1 in /requirements\r\n6d50e0c docs: Clarifications for data channel payload\r\nd1bc5ee cq: Remove unwanted files\r\nc623b39 net: Log instead of raise in tcp_keepalive\r\n721872d build(deps): bump isort from 5.10.0 to 5.10.1 in /requirements\r\n486dbcf build(deps): bump isort from 5.9.3 to 5.10.0 in /requirements\r\n5eb4152 core: Create copy of config in connect\r\n34e9c67 conf: Implement __deepcopy__ in BaseConfig\r\n98abc57 conf: Implement __deepcopy__ in BaseConfig\r\nb71a415 build(deps): bump aiohttp from 3.7.4.post0 to 3.8.0 in /requirements\r\nb478c9d env: Rebuild miniaudio in tests workflow\r\n70a6f94 conf: Ignore services with missing identifier\r\n9393873 build(deps): bump black from 21.9b0 to 21.10b0 in /requirements\r\ne73f256 build(deps): bump zeroconf from 0.36.9 to 0.36.11 in /requirements\r\ndd44437 companion: Use XID for message dispatch\r\n825912d companion: Move CompanionAPI to separate module\r\na02b3b9 companion: Do not wait for initial event update\r\n5a765bc companion: Fix button presses for HID buttons\r\nceddc9f companion: Add support for additional commands\r\nf6a8973 mrp: Migrate protocol to MessageDispatcher\r\nd1332e8 core: Add generic MessageDispatcher\r\n8c7ed2f companion: Improve tests for sessions and events\r\n5f0cb39 companion: Support playback control availability\r\nb3d69a7 companion: Events and persistent connection\r\ne956d79 collection: Add SharedData type\r\nef2ffe8 gha: Fix caching issue for finished job\r\n0227529 docs: Add example connect_with_credentials.py\r\n931acf6 build(deps): update protobuf requirement in /requirements\r\n```"}

This release is thus a micro-update, but it\ncontains a few nuggets.\n\nA `Music` device model has been added that represents the Music app/iTunes. In\nthe same department I've added a property called `raw_model` to `DeviceInfo`,\nreturning a raw model string in case it's not a model known by pyatv. This is\nvery useful for AirPlay receivers as `raw_model` will usually contain the device\nmanufacturer and hardware model.\n\nIt is now possible to pass a set of identifiers to `pyatv.scan`. The intended\nuse case is to pass all identifiers belonging to a device to handle cases where a\nservice is missing or getting deprecated (like MRP).\n\nMaking this release from my phone. In bed. So I will stop there and go to sleep...\n\n**Changes:**\n\n*Protocol: DMAP:*\n\n```\n180acab dmap: Avoid unnecessary creation of Zeroconf\n2e32274 dmap: Add device model Music for Music/iTunes\n```\n\n*Protocol: MRP:*\n\n```\n7a8b86a mrp: Updates to volume management\n```\n\n*Protocol: Companion:*\n\n```\nb28a01e companion: Improve pairing requirement detection\n```\n\n*Other:*\n\n```\nce90dd6 core: Add raw_model to DeviceInfo\ne063ffb scan: Support scanning for multiple identifiers\n```\n\n**All changes:**\n\n```\n22bf5f2 companion: Enable test that should be enabled\n180acab dmap: Avoid unnecessary creation of Zeroconf\nce90dd6 core: Add raw_model to DeviceInfo\n2e32274 dmap: Add device model Music for Music/iTunes\n3623287 fix wrong param\nb28a01e companion: Improve pairing requirement detection\ne063ffb scan: Support scanning for multiple identifiers\n7a8b86a mrp: Updates to volume management\n```\n\n"}

Yeah, right, tvOS 15 was released the day before yesterday\r\nwhich broke everything. My intention was to release 0.9.0 before tvOS 15\r\ndropped, but things kept popping up and I had no choice but to delay. So here\r\nwe are.\r\n\r\nThe biggest feature in this release is obviously support for tvOS 15. Perhaps\r\nnot the most exciting feature per se, but important as most of the\r\nfunctionality in pyatv is lost without it. The gist is that Apple decided to\r\ndrop support for the MRP protocol introduced in tvOS. In practice they didn't\r\nget rid or it, they just allocated a special stream type in AirPlay (2) and\r\ndecided to tunnel MRP over it. So MRP is still there, it's just carried over\r\nAirPlay now. As far as I know, this is how they have done it the last couple of\r\niOS/tvOS releases. So it's not really new, just something no one looked into.\r\nThe deprecation of the \"regular\" MRP protocol is reasonable (who uses the\r\nRemote app nowadays?), so I don't blame Apple for it. Would have been nice to\r\nhave figured this out earlier though, as it required a lot of intense reverse\r\nengineering to unravel everything. Now it does work though, so totally worth\r\nit! I have tried to document how it works on the protocols page:\r\n\r\nhttps://pyatv.dev/documentation/protocols/\r\n\r\nAll needed to get things working again is to provide AirPlay credentials. One\r\nimportant thing to note though is that you need to re-pair with this release\r\n(or later) to get new credentials. The old ones will only work with `play_url`,\r\nnot for tunneling MRP over AirPlay. A small bonus here is that the HomePod\r\nworks in the same way as the Apple TV in this regards, so pyatv can now be used\r\nto control HomdPods as well. No pairing is needed for that, it's just\r\nplug-and-play!\r\n\r\nLet's leave MRP now... My vision for pyatv is to create a \"core\", where\r\nprotocols work as plugins to provide functionality. The API used by developers\r\nis supposed be towards core and not the protocols themselves. This basically\r\nmeans that all functions in the API should behave in the same way, no matter\r\nwhat protocols are used in regards to arguments, return values, listener\r\ninterfaces, error handling and so on. This release contains a lof of work\r\ntowards realizing that vision. I'm not quite there yet, but it's closer than\r\never. Hopefully, this will only manifest itself through more consistent\r\nbehavior and not much you as a developer need to pay any attention to. But if\r\nyou notice any changes in behavior, this might be the reason. Be sure to report\r\nanything that you find peculiar, it might need fixing or an explanation.\r\n\r\nAnother minor new feature is that the Audio interface has been extended to\r\ninclude volume_up and volume_down, which also means those methods are\r\ndeprecated in `RemoteControl`. Please update your code for this. Also, all the\r\nprotocol specic service types, e.g. `conf.MrpService` and `conf.AirPlayService`\r\nhave been deprecated in favor of `conf.ManualService`. Update your code for\r\nthis as well, in case you rely on any of them. They will stick around for a few\r\nreleases, so your code won't break because of this. The last minor feature is a\r\nhelper method called `helpers.is_streamable`, which can check if file is\r\nsupported by `Stream.stream_file`.\r\n\r\nOne last thing... This release fills a big gap that has been present for a long\r\ntime: when do you need to pair? Each service now contains a \"pairing\" property\r\nthat will tell you of pairing is needed or not. This makes it possible to\r\nprogrammatically determine if the pairing procedure needs to to performed,\r\nsomething that wasn't clear before. After scanning, just iterate all services\r\nand pair the ones requiring it. A similar property has been added for passwords\r\nas well, called `requires_password`. If True, then a password is required to\r\nconnect. Only applicable to RAOP so far (it works for AirPlay as well, but\r\nthere's no support for passwords in AirPlay yet).\r\n\r\nTo round things up, I just wanted to say that docker images are automatically\r\nbuilt for new releases as well as the latest commit on master, making it easy\r\nto test pyatv without having to install any additional software other than\r\ndocker. I still have some areas to improve, but it's a good start. This release\r\nwill be the first release having docker images pre-built as it's tricky to\r\nbackport.\r\n\r\nThat is it for now. Make sure to check out the migration guide to get some\r\nhints on what you need to do when upgrading.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out the migration notes before

Highlights this time is\r\nimproved scanning, password protected RAOP services, support\r\nfor HSCP and some remote buttons in Companion.\r\n\r\nAn issue hwere some devices were not discovered by Home Assistant\r\nanymore suddenly appeared (pun intended). Some digging concluded\r\nthat asking for too many Zeroconf services in one request might\r\nyield a response too big to fit in one IP packet. This makes the\r\nsender silently drop records, rendering the response incomplete\r\nwithout pyatv knowing that. Since Companion and RAOP was added in\r\n0.8.0 (which require three new services in total), that was the\r\ntipping point. From now on, pyatv will spread services over a few\r\nrequests to work around this issue.\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to stream audio to password protected AirPlay\r\nreceivers thanks to @Schlaubischlump! A password can be passed\r\nto atvremote via `--raop-password` and it's explained how to do\r\nit programmatically in the documentation.\r\n\r\nHSCP (unsure what it stands for, maybe something like\r\n*Home Sharing Control Protocol*?) is used to control instances of\r\niTunes or Music running on a Mac. Unfortunately, Apple decided\r\nto require FairPlay authentication in macOS 11.4, so this will\r\nonly work if you are running an OS with lower version number than\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nSome buttons in the remote control interface is now supported by\r\nthe Companion protocol. The API reference on\r\n[pyatv.dev](https://pyatv.dev) actually lists which which protocols\r\nimplement a certain feature now, so it's recommended to look there\r\nfor current status.\r\n\r\nThere are a few house-keeping fixes in this release as well,\r\nmostly related to tests, documentation and environment.

Scheduling has also been changed to work\r\nwith \"global time\" (from stream start) instead of per frame. These changes\r\nimprove streaming stability, with less chance of getting out of sync. They were\r\nalso necessary to get streaming working on Windows.\r\n\r\nAnother important addition in the streaming department is the ability to read\r\ninput from a FILE-like object, instead of just from a filename. One usecase for\r\nthis is to take input via stdin from another process and send it to a receiver.\r\n`atvremote` has been adjusted to read from stdin if `-` is specified as\r\nfilename. Here's an example streaming output from ffmpeg (RTSP as input!):\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nffmpeg -i rtsp://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net/vod/mp4:BigBuckBunny_115k.mov -f mp3 - | atvremote -s 10.0.10.184 --debug stream_file=-\r\n```\r\n\r\nDocumentation for this:\r\n\r\nhttps://pyatv.dev/documentation/atvremote/#streaming\r\nhttps://pyatv.dev/development/stream/#stream-a-file\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n\r\n*Protocol: RAOP:*\r\n\r\nf41d552 raop: Sync sending based on absolute time\r\nbd15ff2 raop: Use perf_counter instead of monotonic\r\n4abfc94 raop: Add small buffer to BufferedReaderSource\r\nee1ee94 raop: Fix timing when starting to stream\r\n8096928 raop: Support streaming files from a buffer\r\n\r\n**All changes:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nf41d552 raop: Sync sending based on absolute time\r\nbd15ff2 raop: Use perf_counter instead of monotonic\r\n03f9a6b build(deps): bump mypy from 0.902 to 0.910\r\n244d9ee build(deps): bump isort from 5.8.0 to 5.9.1\r\na23c144 docs: Add missing tutorial example\r\n4abfc94 raop: Add small buffer to BufferedReaderSource\r\nee1ee94 raop: Fix timing when starting to stream\r\n8096928 raop: Support streaming files from a buffer\r\na2df952 docs: Add tutorial as an example\r\n6cf2f4c build(deps): bump types-protobuf from 0.1.12 to 0.1.13\r\n```\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/postlund/pyatv/pull/1173\"><img src=\"https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg\"/></a>\r\n\r\n"}

First and foremost, it\r\nintroduces support for not one but *two* new protocols: Companion and RAOP. The\r\nCompanion protocol is used to list and launch apps installed on an Apple TV as well\r\nimproving power management support. RAOP adds support for proper audio streaming\r\nto AirPlay receivers. Both protocols are still early in development and may contains a\r\nfew bugs (yeah...). You will likely see new features added to these over time.\r\n\r\nA big new change in this release, that isn't really noticeable at first, is a new layer\r\nthat relays calls between public interface methods and underlying protocols. What does\r\nthis mean then? Well, we have the public interfaces (Metadata, RemoteControl. etc.)\r\nand the protocols implementing them (DMAP, MRP, RAOP, etc). Prior to this release,\r\nDMAP and MRP would fully implement all of the interfaces (with a minor exception of\r\nStream) and there was a requirement to configure one of them. From now on however,\r\nthere's no such restriction as it's possible to connect to any number of protocols.\r\nThe Feature interface tells us what is actually supported. The new layer (internally\r\ncalled *facade*) will automatically figure out which of the available protocol has the\r\nmost appropriate implementation and call that. If two protocols implement the same\r\ninterface method, there's mechanisms internally to pick the best one. An example is\r\nthe Power interface, where MRP and Companion both provide implementations for `turn_on`\r\nand `turn_off`. If both these protocols are configured, then the implementations\r\nprovided by the Companion protocol will be used (as they are better), otherwise\r\nfallback will happen to MRP.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, the change log format changes a bit to list changes per protocol and\r\nscripts. The goal is to make it easier to see what has changed or been fixed. This\r\nrelease also introduces release names and all releases from now on will get a release\r\nname based on characters from Five Nights Freddy's. First letter of the next release\r\nname follows the letter of the previous one (the next release will be called\r\nGlitchtrap for instance). Oh, and this release text is also new...\r\n\r\nOther changes include a *big* overhaul of the documentation. A lot of things have\r\nbeen improved and added, for instance a new tutorial and a few new examples. There's\r\na configuration for GitPod, so you can get going with pyatv development with a single\r\nclick!\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out the migration notes before upgrading:\r\n\r\nhttps://pyatv.dev/support/migration/\r\n\r\nThere's also a new page with a better summary of supported features:\r\n\r\nhttps://pyatv.dev/documentation/supported_features/\r\n\r\nI guess that is it!\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n\r\n*Protocol: DMAP:*\r\n\r\n* Reset revision if push update fails (#1004) fixes #1000\r\n\r\n*Protocol: MRP:*\r\n\r\n* bug: Do not deep copy protobuf messages (#1105) fixes #1038\r\n* bug: Handle missing artwork gracefully (#1033) fixes #937\r\n* bug: Implement and enforce internal protocol state (#1009) fixes #1007\r\n\r\n*Protocol: AirPlay:*\r\n\r\n* General clean up of module but no new features\r\n\r\n*Protocol: Companion:*\r\n\r\n* Initial release\r\n* Adds the Apps interface (list and launch apps)\r\n* Implements turn_on and turn_off in the Power interface\r\n\r\n*Protocol: RAOP:*\r\n\r\n* Initial release\r\n* Supports streaming WAV, MP3, OGG and Vorbis files\r\n* Reads metadata from supported formats (artist, album and title)\r\n* Supports volume controls\r\n\r\n*Script: atvlog:*\r\n\r\n* Exit if no output was generated (#1001)\r\n* Support serving output via web server (#997)\r\n\r\n*Script: atvremote:*\r\n\r\n* Fix bugs in manual mode (parameters not respected properly)\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\n* audio-metadata, bitarray and miniaudio are new dependencies in this release\r\n* At least version 3.12.0 of protobuf is required\r\n\r\n**All changes:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n6ffef9f build(deps): bump pytest-xdist from 2.2.1 to 2.3.0\r\n8e5691c build(deps): bump mypy-protobuf from 1.24 to 2.4\r\n70ef974 docs: Add examples\r\nb91b099 deps: Don't bump bitarray past 2.1.2\r\n1914a04 docs: Clarification regarding device listener\r\n0bc6eae docs: Add a tutorial\r\n5bbb81a docs: Update migration guide for 0.8.0\r\n4d9dbd4 scan: Migrate to use get_unique_id internally\r\n0049db1 scan: Be more forgiving if service parsing fails\r\necacad7 tests: Make RAOP work in fake device\r\nc36e6b5 raop: Teardown session after streaming\r\n116d29d build(deps): bump zeroconf from 0.28.0 to 0.28.2\r\nb8c3819 scripts: Unset PIP_USER in setup_dev_env.sh\r\ncd849b7 Upgrade to GitHub-native Dependabot\r\n5f590f5 build(deps): Bump bitarray from 2.1.2 to 2.1.3\r\naa4b53d raop: Fallback to AirPlay credentials\r\na5bd14c raop: Only perform auth-setup for AirPort Express\r\n795081b docs: Various documentation updates\r\n6cfa66c helpers: Add get_unique_id\r\n1c3adcf mypy: Fix typing issues\r\n73bb7fa build(deps): Bump mypy from 0.812 to 0.902\r\n85d03f0 build(deps): Update bitarray requirement from <2.1.1,==2.1.0 to ==2.1.2\r\ncc5bc8c raop: Support devices not implementing /info\r\ndae7518 raop: Minor updates to documentation\r\n1b3c183 raop: Handle muted volume level\r\ncf2696e raop: Only allow one stream at the time\r\neaec0a5 raop: Support set_volume, volume_up, volume_down\r\n462512e raop: Make sure authentication is performed early\r\n3b37ec8 raop: Initial volume support\r\n15e4501 support: Add map_range function\r\n4ed1b2c facade: Enforce percentage level for audio\r\n0dea45f deps: Temporarily lock bitarray <2.1.1\r\nc1acb3b build(deps): Bump black from 21.5b2 to 21.6b0\r\n8e13c3c build(deps): Bump codespell from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0\r\nb844966 raop: Correctly implement position in metadata\r\n1d665d5 raop: Support progress (position and total_time)\r\nfae7b41 cq: Clean up usage of ensure_future\r\n6c0cd54 raop: Fix instability in retransmission test\r\nc2f7287 raop: Send feedback if supported by receiver\r\n58220e5 raop: Avoid blocking I/O when loading metadata\r\n7eb961d raop: Avoid blocking I/O in MiniaudioWrapper\r\n292fbb5 raop: Add initial functional tests\r\n68abbdc audiogen: Add new script to generate audio files\r\n5f3d1a8 raop: Add basic fake device\r\n32f8ed7 http: Add a simple web server implementation\r\nf1bfce3 build(deps): Bump pytest-cov from 2.12.0 to 2.12.1\r\n044f55e build(deps): Bump pylint from 2.8.2 to 2.8.3\r\neb2d36d build(deps): Bump black from 21.5b1 to 21.5b2\r\n1d2b3a1 env: Don't post comment with GitPod link\r\n2b5b280 http: Ignore type mypy cannot find\r\n18d1597 http: Ignore case in when parsing headers\r\n0bd54d8 airplay: Fix encoding name typo\r\ne65eb59 airplay: Fix patching in tests\r\n74401a0 raop: Use feedback endpoint for keep-alive\r\n428b9b1 raop: Verify using AirPlay if credentials provided\r\n99f3037 airplay: Unify credentials with other protocols AirPlay was the first protocol to introduce SRP and credentials and suffers some internal design flaws that were improved when implementing the other protocols.
