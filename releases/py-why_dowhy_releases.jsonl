Of course, you can specify any custom ML method.\r\n\r\n* Added a new BootstrapRefuter that simulates the issue of measurement error with confounders.

For example, \"backdoor.dowhy.propensity_score_matching\". Not a breaking change, so you can keep using the old naming scheme too.\r\n\t* EconML-specific: Since EconML assumes that effect modifiers are a subset of confounders, a warning is issued if a user specifies effect modifiers outside of confounders and tries to use EconML methods.\r\n\r\n* CI and Standard errors: Added bootstrap-based confidence intervals and standard errors for all methods. For linear regression estimator, also implemented the corresponding parametric forms.\r\n\r\n* Convenience functions for getting confidence intervals, standard errors and conditional treatment effects (CATE), that can be called after fitting the estimator if needed\r\n\r\n* Better coverage for tests. Also, tests are now seeded with a random seed, so more dependable tests.\r\n\r\nThanks to @Tanmay-Kulkarni101 and @Arshiaarya  for their contributions!"}
