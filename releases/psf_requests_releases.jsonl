(#6074)\r\n- Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping `urllib3.exceptions.SSLError` with\r\n  `requests.exceptions.SSLError` for `content` and `iter_content`. (#6057)\r\n- Fixed issue where invalid Windows registry entires caused proxy resolution\r\n  to raise an exception rather than ignoring the entry.

(#5928)\r\n\r\n- Added a `requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError` to unify JSON exceptions between\r\n  Python 2 and 3. This gets raised in the `response.json()` method, and is\r\n  backwards compatible as it inherits from previously thrown exceptions.\r\n  Can be caught from `requests.exceptions.RequestException` as well. (#5856)\r\n\r\n- Improved error text for misnamed `InvalidSchema` and `MissingSchema`\r\n  exceptions. This is a temporary fix until exceptions can be renamed\r\n  (Schema->Scheme). (#6017)\r\n\r\n- Improved proxy parsing for proxy URLs missing a scheme. This will address\r\n  recent changes to `urlparse` in Python 3.9+. (#5917)\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes**\r\n\r\n- Fixed defect in `extract_zipped_paths` which could result in an infinite loop\r\n  for some paths. (#5851)\r\n\r\n- Fixed handling for `AttributeError` when calculating length of files obtained\r\n  by `Tarfile.extractfile()`. (#5239)\r\n\r\n- Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping `urllib3.exceptions.InvalidHeader` with\r\n  `requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader`. (#5914)\r\n\r\n- Fixed bug where two Host headers were sent for chunked requests. (#5391)\r\n\r\n- Fixed regression in Requests 2.26.0 where `Proxy-Authorization` was\r\n  incorrectly stripped from all requests sent with `Session.send`. (#5924)\r\n\r\n- Fixed performance regression in 2.26.0 for hosts with a large number of\r\n  proxies available in the environment. (#5924)\r\n\r\n- Fixed idna exception leak, wrapping `UnicodeError` with\r\n  `requests.exceptions.InvalidURL` for URLs with a leading dot (.) in the\r\n  domain. (#5414)\r\n\r\n**Deprecations**\r\n\r\n- Requests support for Python 2.7 and 3.6 will be ending in 2022. While we\r\n  don't have exact dates, Requests 2.27.x is likely to be the last release\r\n  series providing support.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @steveberdy made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/5877\r\n* @Akay7 made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/5821\r\n* @mgorny made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/5890\r\n* @tl-hbk made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/5851\r\n* @itsadok made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/5899\r\n* @theGOTOguy made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/5906\r\n* @verhovsky made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/5910\r\n* @hodbn made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/5391\r\n* @davisagli made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/5993\r\n* @vashisthabhinav made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/5998\r\n* @mondeja made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/5414\r\n* @gdubicki made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/5382\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/v2.27.0/HISTORY.md#2270-2022-01-03", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/releases/56555733/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "mentions_count": 12}
