Caches failed responses for 1 day to reduce server load on ProtonDB and Steam, making it faster to run after stopping a long-running check. In my testing, this reduced a 9000+ game library from over an hour to just a couple of minutes.\r\n- Adds a 3 second timeout to all requests, since by default there is no timeout for requests the script would wait indefinitely for a response that would never come. The exact timeout period may change in the future, this seemed like a good value to me for now though.\r\n- Add a time taken output at the end of the script to give some more info to the user. This should make it easier to spot when regressions that make it take longer happen as well.\r\n- Add a user agent to the script to allow ProtonDB and Steam to measure the traffic that is generated on their servers by this script."}

This will still add the value to your local cache, but will just skip reading it and force fresh data to be retrieved.\r\n- Option to read games list from Steam API\r\n  - The first time you try it, this will ask you for your Steam API key and Steam ID.\r\n    - These values can be cleared from the config by adding the `--clear-config` argument.\r\n  - Both of these will only be stored locally, and will only be used to contact the Steam API.\r\n    - This config will be located in one of these two locations, depending on if you have `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` set.\r\n      - `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ProtonDB-Tags/config.json`\r\n      - `$HOME/.config/ProtonDB-Tags/config.json`\r\n  - **Be warned that using this option will most likely clear the current tags from some of your games, and should only be used as a work-around if games aren't showing up for you.**\r\n  - This can be used by adding `--fetch-games` or `-f` as a command-line flag.\r\n- Fixes #41\r\n- Fixes #42\r\n- Swap broken TravisCI tests with GitHub Actions tests.\r\n- Remove some skipped pylint checks, as these issues have been fixed.\r\n- Update README.md and add issue templates."}
