The main effect of this is that the SDK no longer fetches the remote status of your [project's \"Automatically collect common mobile events\" setting](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004596186#enable-or-disable-common-mobile-events). From this version forward, automatic event tracking can only be controlled by the, now required, parameter `trackAutomaticEvents`. Upon upgrading, existing implementations will need to add this parameter to their Mixpanel initializer calls.\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Add 'trackAutomaticEvents' as a required param in getInstance' and remove Mixpanel server api call for `Autotrack` setting [\\#794](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-android/pull/794)"}

The following information is useful for existing and new Mixpanel customers:\r\n\r\n**How to remove GCM from an existing app**\r\n1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file an remove the following permissions since they are included in FCM already:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<uses-permission android:name=\"com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE\" />\r\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS\" />\r\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WAKE_LOCK\" />\r\n<permission android:name=\"YOUR_PACKAGE.permission.C2D_MESSAGE\" android:protectionLevel=\"signature\" />\r\n<uses-permission android:name=\"YOUR_PACKAGE.permission.C2D_MESSAGE\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Remove the following tag from your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<receiver android:name=\"com.mixpanel.android.mpmetrics.GCMReceiver\"\r\n        android:permission=\"com.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND\" >\r\n        <intent-filter>\r\n                <action android:name=\"com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE\" />\r\n                <action android:name=\"com.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTRATION\" />\r\n                <category android:name=\"YOUR_PACKAGE\" />\r\n         </intent-filter>\r\n</receiver>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Remove GCM from your gradle dependencies:\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\ndependencies {\r\n      compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:10.0.1'   // Remove this line\r\n      ....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Remove any reference to `People.initPushHandling(senderId)` since it's no longer used:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nMixpanelAPI.getInstance(this).getPeople().initPushHandling(SENDER_ID); // Remove this line\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**How to add FCM to your app**\r\n1. Add the following tag inside your `application` tag in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<application>\r\n     ...\r\n     <service\r\n            android:name=\"com.mixpanel.android.mpmetrics.MixpanelFCMMessagingService\"\r\n            android:enabled=\"true\"\r\n            android:exported=\"false\">\r\n            <intent-filter>\r\n                 <action android:name=\"com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT\"/>\r\n            </intent-filter>\r\n      </service>\r\n     ...\r\n</application>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add FCM to your gradle dependencies. You should already have Google Services added, but double check that's the case:\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\nbuildscript {\r\n     ...\r\n     dependencies {\r\n           classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.1.0'\r\n           ...\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n\r\ndependencies {\r\n     implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:17.3.4' // Must be higher than 16.2.0\r\n     ...\r\n}\r\n\r\napply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Place your `google-services.json` file to your Android project. You can grab that file from your [Firebase Console center](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592?hl=en). \r\n\r\n4. We suggest to update your GCM API Key on mixpanel.com and use your FCM Server Key instead. Notice that your existing GCM Key it's now called Legacy token and it is still supported.\r\n\r\n5.

Events created and bound in the UI\nwill still be sent by the application, this directive just disables use the connection gesture\nto pair with a Mixpanel to create and edit event bindings. If the application is run in an\nemulator, it will still check for pairing with the editor.\n\n```\n <meta-data android:name=\"com.mixpanel.android.MPConfig.DisableEmulatorBindingUI\"\n      android:value=\"true\" />\n```\n\nWhen included in your Manifest with value=\"true\", this tag disables pairing with the mobile\nevent binding UI in the Mixpanel web application. Events created and bound in the UI will\nstill be sent by the application, this directive just disables the emulator binding behavior. Use of\nthe connection gesture on a physical device will still work for pairing with the editor.\n\n### Easier use of Proguard with the library\n\nTo use the Mixpanel library with Proguarded builds, add the following to your proguard.cfg file\n\n```\n-keep class com.mixpanel.android.abtesting.** { *; }\n-keep class com.mixpanel.android.mpmetrics.** { *; }\n-keep class com.mixpanel.android.surveys.** { *; }\n-keep class com.mixpanel.android.util.** { *; }\n-keep class com.mixpanel.android.java_websocket.** { *; }\n\n-keepattributes InnerClasses\n\n-keep class **.R\n-keep class **.R$* {\n    <fields>;\n}\n```\n\nMixpanel uses the R class of your package to facilitate easier dynamic tracking across builds of your application.\n\n### The deprecated methods setFlushInterval and checkForSurvey are now no-ops\n\nThis method was deprecated in version 4.0, and now is a no-op. To change the flush\ninterval for your application, use the com.mixpanel.android.MPConfig.FlushInterval\nmeta-data tag in your manifest. To get available surveys, call getSurveyIfAvailable()\n\n### New minimum OS version for advanced features\n\nThe minimum Android OS version necessary for surveys, in app notifications, and dynamic event binding has been increased to JellyBean/API 16. The minimum OS version to use basic tracking features has been increased to Gingerbread/API 9.\n"}

The following meta-data keys are supported:\n\n#### com.mixpanel.android.MPConfig.FlushInterval (value: a time in milliseconds)\n\nIf provided, the library will use this interval instead of the default as a target maximum duration between attempts to flush data to Mixpanel's servers.\n\n#### com.mixpanel.android.MPConfig.DisableFallback (value: a boolean)\n\nIf provided and equal to \"false\", the library will attempt to send data over HTTP if HTTPS fails.\n\n#### com.mixpanel.android.MPConfig.AutoCheckForSurveys (value: a boolean)\n\nIf provided and equal to \"false\", the Mixpanel library will not attempt to retrieve and show surveys automatically, users can still show surveys using MixpanelAPI.getPeople().checkForSurvey and MixpanelAPI.getPeople().showSurvey\n\n#### Maven-Central artifact for Maven, Gradle, and AndroidStudio users\n\nAn aar artifact is now available in the Maven Central repository. You can add Mixpanel to your project by adding the following to your gradle.build file\n\n```\ndependencies {\n    compile \"com.mixpanel.android:mixpanel-android:4.0.0@aar\"\n}\n```\n\n## Changes to the steps required to integrate the Mixpanel library in your project.\n\nIn previous releases, the Mixpanel library was distributed as a jar file. As of 4.0.0, use of the library varies with the build tools chosen.\n\n#### For Eclipse and Ant\n\nFor building with Eclipse or ant, download the Mixpanel repository and follow the steps outlined here, for \"Referencing a Library Project\":\n\nhttp://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject\n\n#### For Gradle and Android Studio\n\nFor building with Gradle or Android Studio- add the following dependency to your build.gradle file\n\n```\n      dependencies {\n          compile \"com.mixpanel.android:mixpanel-android:4.0.0@aar\"\n      }\n```\n\nA version of each release is hosted in Maven central, and will not require you to manually  download or install any artifacts.\n\n### Fallback to HTTP from HTTPS is disabled by default\n\nIn previous releases, the Mixpanel library would automatically fall back to communicating over HTTP if HTTPS communication failed. This was to facilitate use on Android 2.2 (Froyo) and older OS versions, which had poor support for modern SSL certificates.\n\nIn the 4.0.0, HTTP fallback behavior is disabled by default, but can be reenabled for users who intend to ship to older devices by adding the following tags to the <application> tag in your application's AndroidManifest.xml:\n\n```\n <meta-data android:name=\"com.mixpanel.android.MPConfig.DisableFallback\"\n           android:value=\"false\" />\n```\n\n### Improved startup time\n\nPrevious releases performed some synchronous disk IO immediately when instances were created. This was typically very quick, but in 4.0.0 this IO is done in a separate thread and loaded lazily by the library.\n\n### API Behavior changes\n\n#### Passing a null token or null context to MixpanelAPI.getInstance() will now result in a null return value.\n\n#### The automatic $bluetooth_enabled property will only appear in recent OS versions\n\nThe automatic $bluetooth_enabled property will only be added automatically on devices with OS version greater than API 18/OS version 4.3/Jelly Bean MR2. This feature had a  critical bug on older platforms, and was not in popular use.\n\n#### Super properties named \"distinct_id\" will be ignored\n\nPrevious versions of the library allowed setting \"distinct_id\" as a super property, and would use this value as the distinct id for event tracking. This behavior has been removed, and super properties with the name \"distinct_id\" will be ignored. Callers can still provide  their own value for \"distinct_id\" in the properties argument to track.\n\n#### A scary stack trace log in the common, not-scary case of fallback from HTTPS to HTTP has been removed.\n\n#### MixpanelAPI.setFlushInterval() has been deprecated.\n\nUse the meta-data tag:\n\n```\n <meta-data android:name=\"com.mixpanel.android.MPConfig.FlushInterval\"\n   android:value=\"XXX\" />\n```\n\ninstead, where \"XXX\" is the desired interval in Milliseconds.\n\n#### MixpanelAPI.enableFallbackServer() has been deprecated.\n\nUse the meta-data tag:\n\n```\n<meta-data android:name=\"com.mixpanel.android.MPConfig.DisableFallback\"\n  android:value=\"false\" />\n```\n\nto enable fallback to HTTP if HTTPS is unavailable or the library is running on an Android 2.2 or older device.\n\n#### Default build system for library is now Gradle\n\nant is no longer the primary build system for development. Although we intend to continue to support ant builds of the library, we will be using gradle to build and package the library going forward.\n"}
