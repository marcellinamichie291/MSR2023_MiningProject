(#601)\r\n    * Maven classifier for macOS: `natives-macos-arm64`\r\n    * Maven classifier for Windows: `natives-windows-arm64`\r\n- Linux: Shared libraries are now built with GCC 7.5 (up from GCC 4.8)\r\n- Generator: Struct member javadoc moved to the corresponding getter method.\r\n    * There are links to the getter method in the class javadoc (`Layout` section) and in the javadoc of the corresponding setter and `.Buffer` accessors. \r\n    * Makes it easier to navigate to the documentation of a particular member.\r\n- Generator: simplified stack allocation methods in `Struct` classes.\r\n    * 4 new methods added, named `malloc` and `calloc`, without a \"Stack\" suffix.\r\n    * 8 old methods with the \"Stack\" suffix are now deprecated, to be removed in LWJGL `3.4.0`.\r\n- Core: Replaced internal usages of dyncall with libffi.\r\n    * This resolves a range of long-standing issues, mainly with upcalls (callbacks).\r\n    * Single native callback handler used for all upcalls, regardless of signature. Arguments and return values handled Java-side (per callback type).\r\n    * Improved upcall performance (before: JNI downcall per argument, after: simple memory accesses)\r\n    * Support for structs returned by-value. (#283)\r\n- Core: Implemented overflow protection in text encoding methods.\r\n- Core: When LWJGL fails to resolve native libraries, it will now attempt to report native JAR files in the classpath with mismatching platform/architecture. (#587)\r\n- Core: The `SharedLibraryLoader` now prefers to extract natives to the working directory, over the user's home directory.\r\n- Core: Added version information to module descriptors. (#685)\r\n    * The LWJGL version/build used will now be included in stacktraces of modular applications. \r\n- docs: The javadoc of callback classes/interfaces now includes a link to the corresponding `invoke` method, for better IDE navigation.\r\n- macOS: Shared libraries are now built with Xcode 11.3 (up from 10.0)\r\n- GLFW: Added overrides for internally loaded shared libraries.\r\n    * Useful when there's a mismatch with the library loaded by LWJGL.\r\n    * `GLFWNativeEGL.setEGLPath` & `GLFWNativeEGL.setGLESPath`\r\n    * `GLFWNativeGLX.setPath`\r\n    * `GLFWNativeNSGL.setFramework`\r\n    * `GLFWNativeWGL.setPath`\r\n    * `GLFWVulkan.setPath`\r\n- GLFW: There is now a single Linux native that supports both X11 and Wayland.\r\n    * Use `glfwPlatformSupported(GLFW_PLATFORM_WAYLAND)` to test if Wayland is available.\r\n    * Use `glfwInitHint(GLFW_PLATFORM, GLFW_PLATFORM_WAYLAND)` to enable the Wayland backend.\r\n- GL: Added support for OSMesa contexts. (#595)\r\n- GL/GLES/AL: Added `createCapabilities` overloads that accept an `IntFunction<PointerBuffer>`. Enables explicit management of the off-heap memory used by the capabilities instances.\r\n- GL/GLES/AL: When capabilities creation fails, the current thread/process capabilities state is no longer reset to null.\r\n- GL/GLES/AL/CL/EGL: Added `Configuration` options to forcibly disable specific extensions for debugging purposes. (#683)\r\n- OpenAL: Introduced `ALC::setCapabilities`. Rarely useful when opening multiple devices with different ALC capabilities. (#582)\r\n- Vulkan: Struct classes now include an additional `sType` setter that writes the appropriate struct type value. (#537)\r\n- Vulkan: Struct classes now include type-safe `pNext` setters, one for each struct type that is known to extend them.\r\n    * These setters **prepend** the struct to the `pNext` chain, enabling cleaner code when chaining multiple structs.\r\n    * Order does not matter, but do note that structs will be chained in the reverse order of the `pNext` calls.\r\n    * Also be careful when the base struct is `malloc`ed, make sure to call `.pNext(NULL)` first, otherwise the last struct in the chain will point to invalid memory.\r\n\r\n#### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Generator: Native libraries are now initialized before constants. (#630)\r\n- Core: Fixed unsafe field reads in `MemoryUtil` setup code. (#632)\r\n- Core: The `SharedLibraryLoader` now prepends a `.` to `SHARED_LIBRARY_EXTRACT_DIRECTORY` when the target directory is not temporary.\r\n- Core: The `SharedLibraryLoader` will now load libraries in the correct `ClassLoader` when testing for [JDK-8195129](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8195129). (#648)\r\n- Core: Changed the encoding of `dlopen` paths to UTF-8. (#691)\r\n- CUDA: Implemented missing `cuIpcOpenEventHandle`/`cuIpcOpenMemHandle` using libFFI.\r\n- EGL: Fixed nullability of `eglInitialize` arguments.\r\n- GLFW: Fixed main thread check. Setting `GLFW_CHECK_THREAD0` to `false` is now required for offscreen interop. (#538)\r\n- OpenCL: Added missing `errcode_ret` parameter to `clLinkProgram`. (#560)\r\n- OpenGL: Restored `GL_TEXTURE` in the core profile. (#573)\r\n- OpenGL: Added buffer object offset overloads to `GetQueryObject*` functions.\r\n- stb: Removed redundant `stb_image_resize` overloads. (#605)\r\n- Vulkan: Fixed GLFW configuration for MoltenVK. (#502)\r\n- Vulkan: Fixed `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` to work with `null` instance arguments.\r\n- Vulkan: Fixed unsigned arithmetic in `VK_VERSION_MAJOR` and `VK_VERSION_MINOR` macros.\r\n    \r\n#### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n```\r\n(B): binary incompatible change\r\n(S): source incompatible change\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Linux: Shared libraries are now built on Ubuntu 18.04 (up from Ubuntu 16.04) (B)\r\n    * GLIBC versions older than 2.14 are no longer supported. Some, but not all, LWJGL natives may require up to GLIBC 2.27.\r\n    * Applications deployed on older systems must now build & bundle custom LWJGL natives. Contact LWJGL developers if you need assistance.\r\n- Removed deprecated methods that were marked for removal in LWJGL 3.3. (S)\r\n- Core: Users of the dyncall bindings must migrate to libffi. (S)\r\n- CUDA: Merged versioned classes into a single class that contains the entire functionality. (S)\r\n    * The bindings still require CUDA 3.2 as the minimum version. There are runtime checks for functions introduced after 3.2.\r\n- Shaderc: The shaderc_spvc library has been removed since Shaderc 2020.4. Users may migrate to the new SPIRV-Cross bindings.

Earlier versions do not need to be imported separately.\r\n- perf(core): `memGetAddress`/`memPutAddress` are now an order of magnitude faster on 32-bit JVMs.\r\n- perf(core): Optimized pointer arithmetic by helping the JVM identify unsigned integers.\r\n- perf(core): The new `java.util.Objects` index check intrinsics are used on Java 9.\r\n- perf(core): `MemoryUtil` string decoding methods are now faster on both Java 8 and 9+.\r\n    * The Java 9 implementations are tuned for compact strings ([JEP 254](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/254)).\r\n- perf(generator):  Function pointers in capabilities classes are not sorted by name anymore.\r\n    * This makes it more likely that for functions that are commonly used together, their respective pointers\r\n    will be closer in memory, avoiding unnecessary cache misses.\r\n- Generator: `org.lwjgl.system.JNI` now includes signatures for known callback functions.\r\n    * Can be used for callback function delegation.\r\n- Generator: Added support for custom methods in struct classes.\r\n- Generator: Added fluent setters for nested structs.\r\n- Generator: Made StructBuffer subclass generation optional.\r\n- Loader: Now prints the path of shared libraries loaded from system paths in debug mode, when possible.\r\n- docs(core): Improved `PointerBuffer` javadoc.\r\n- docs: The LWJGL javadoc is now generated with JDK 10.\r\n- Core: `MemoryUtil` methods now replace requests for zero-size allocations with non-zero-size allocations.\r\n    * A zero-size allocation now always returns a non-`NULL` pointer or throws an `OOME`. This is consistent with `ByteBuffer.allocateDirect` and avoids the undefined behavior of native allocators.\r\n    * The returned buffer has a capacity of zero, regardless of the actual allocation size.\r\n- Core `MemoryUtil.memRealloc` is not `@Nullable` anymore, will either succeed or throw an `OOME`, like `memAlloc/memCalloc`.\r\n- Core: It is now possible to create a `MemoryStack` backed by externally managed memory.\r\n- Core: The debug allocator now also tracks internal allocations of shared libraries that have been configured to use the LWJGL memory allocator.\r\n    * This enables monitoring/debugging allocations inside shared libraries. Internal resources that are never released are now reported on shutdown.\r\n    * Enabled by default when `Configuration.DEBUG_MEMORY_ALLOCATOR` is enabled.\r\n    * May be disabled with `Configuration.DEBUG_MEMORY_ALLOCATOR_INTERNAL.set(false)`. \r\n- LMDB: The LWJGL memory allocator is now used for internal allocations.\r\n- NanoVG/NanoSVG: The LWJGL memory allocator is now used for internal allocations.\r\n- OpenGL/GLES: Calling an unavailable function triggers a JNI `FatalError` instead of an arbitrary segfault.\r\n    * Avoids the intimidating crash log and writes a clean stack trace to `stderr`.\r\n\r\n#### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Generator: Fixed nullability of macro bindings.\r\n- Generator: Fixed location of generated static blocks\r\n- Core: Struct buffer `malloc/calloc` methods now support zero capacity, instead of throwing a `NPE`.\r\n- macOS: Fixed version number detection in `.dylib` name mapping\r\n- Nullability fixes in:\r\n    * Assimp\r\n    * CGL\r\n    * Yoga\r\n    * Parameters of struct multi-setter methods\r\n- OpenCL: Fixed `CL_DEVICE_PREFERRED_VECTOR_WIDTH_INT` constant name.\r\n- OpenCL: Dropped unnecessary `clSetKernalArg3<t>` overloads.\r\n- OpenGL/GLES: The thread-local-free function pointer lookups do not depend on JVMTI anymore.\r\n- stb: Fixed type of `stbi_write_jpg` function's `data` parameter. \r\n\r\n#### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- Core: `MemoryUtil.MemoryAllocationReport` now also returns the address of the memory allocation.\r\n- NanoVG: Parameters `windowWidth`/`windowHeight` of the `nvgBeginFrame` function changed to `float`.\r\n\r\n#### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- vma: The native library is not initialized automatically.\r\n    * Workaround: call `Class.forName(\"org.lwjgl.util.vma.LibVma\")` before using the VMA bindings.\r\n- vma: `KHR_get_memory_requirements2` function addresses in `VmaVulkanFunctions` are not optional.\r\n    * Workaround: Enable the `KHR_get_memory_requirements2` extension, or set the equivalent function addresses from Vulkan `1.1`."}

(#344)\r\n    * Enables static analysis tools ([FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/), IDEs) to detect accesses that could cause `NullPointerException`. Eliminating those improves the quality of LWJGL applications.\r\n    * Enables better interopation with JVM-based languages that feature built-in null-safety. For example, see [Kotlin's JSR-305 support](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html#jsr-305-support).\r\n- Added `Configuration` setting to disable function lookup checks.\r\n- lmdb: Databases are now binary compatible across 32 & 64-bit architectures. (#364)\r\n    * `MDB_VL32` is enabled on 32-bit builds.\r\n- par_shapes: Patched to support 32-bit indices and extremely dense meshes.\r\n- stb_truetype: Exposed members of internal structures for advanced glyph packing customization. (#358)\r\n- Tootle: Now supports the Direct3D rasterizer for overdraw optimization.\r\n\r\n#### Fixes\r\n\r\n- JPMS: A natives module now `requires transitive` the corresponding Java module, instead of the opposite. (#334)\r\n    * Enables loading shared libraries from non-modular paths/JARs.\r\n- JPMS: `module-info` files have been moved under `META-INF/version/9/` (#334)\r\n    * All LWJGL artifacts are now multi-release JAR files to avoid trouble with older tools that are not compatible with Java 9.\r\n- JPMS: Added appropriate `requires static` declarations to satisfy optional binding interop dependencies. (#369)\r\n- Fixed broken javadoc links in all bindings. Also updated URLs to avoid redirects.\r\n- bgfx: Restored default API thread encoder functions, that were erroneously removed in `3.1.4`.\r\n- LibOVR: Fixed `ovr_TraceMessage` signature. \r\n- OpenAL: Fixed capability name of the `AL_SOFT_source_resampler` extension.\r\n- Tootle: Fixed `pnClusterRemapOut` parameter validation.\r\n\r\n#### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- Several methods that previously accepted `null`/`NULL` and returned `null`, now require non-null input.\r\n    * Applies to: struct & callback creation methods and `memByteBuffer`/`memUTF8`/`stack.UTF8`/etc.\r\n    * Added corresponding methods with the `Safe` suffix that accept `null`/`NULL`, matching the old behavior.\r\n    * With this change the common case (non-null input) requires no code changes and is warning/error-free. The uncommon case (null input) is recognizable (the suffix) and must be handled properly to eliminate warnings/errors. \r\n- Allocation methods that returned `null`/`NULL` on allocation failure, now throw `OutOfMemoryError` instead. This matches the behavior of `ByteBuffer.allocateDirect`.\r\n    * Applies to: struct allocation methods and `memAlloc`/`memCalloc`/etc.\r\n    * Does not apply to allocations via direct binding calls (e.g. `LibCStdlib.malloc`).\r\n- Getters of struct members that should never be `NULL`, throw `NullPointerException` instead of returning `null` when the struct instance is not initialized.\r\n    * Use `Struct::isNull` to test pointer members of untrusted struct instances.\r\n- bgfx: Restored native mapping of `bgfx_init(_vendorId)` and `bgfx_update_texture_cube(_side)` parameters. (#368)\r\n- bgfx: `uint16_t` bitfield constants are now mapped to `int`. (#368)\r\n- glfw: `glfwInitHintString` has been renamed to `glfwWindowHintString`.\r\n- lmdb: Databases developed on 32-bit architectures must be recreated. (#364)\r\n- par_shapes: Changed `par_shapes_mesh::triangles` from `uint16_t/ShortBuffer` to `uint32_t/IntBuffer`. \r\n- stb_rect_pack: `stbrp_rect::was_packed` is now mapped to Java `boolean`."}

(#175)\n- Added [Vulkanl](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) bindings. (#50)\n- Added [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) bindings. (#99)\n- Added [NativeFileDialog](https://github.com/mlabbe/nativefiledialog) bindings.\n- Added [par_shapes.h](http://github.prideout.net/shapes) bindings.\n- Added [dyncall](http://www.dyncall.org/) bindings.\n- Added [jawt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_AWT_Native_Interface) bindings for AWT/Swing integration. (#125)\n- Added simple OS-specific **window creation** bindings, for custom window/context creation. (#105)\n- Added missing OpenCL and OpenAL **extensions**.\n- **Fully documented** OpenCL and OpenAL.\n- Moved **WGL** and **GLX** capabilities to the new `WGLCapabilities` and `GLXCapabilities` classes, respectively. Functionality in WGL, GLX and corresponding extensions that does not require a current context can now be used without creating a dummy context first. (#171)\n\n**IMPROVEMENTS**\n- Added **stack allocation** APIs (the `MemoryStack` class and new allocation methods in struct classes and `MemoryUtil`).\n- Made the implementations of `PointerBuffer` and `Struct/StructBuffer` subclasses as lightweight as possible. This makes it easier for escape analysis to **eliminate allocations**.\n- Minor struct API improvements.\n- Added **nullability information** to **struct members**, to protect against buggy code crashing the JVM.\n- All bindings are updated to the **latest versions** of the corresponding libraries. Notably, GLFW now has `glfwSetWindowIcon` and `glfwSetWindowMonitor`, it now doesn't lack anything compared to LWJGL 2's Display.\n- Refactored callbacks for Java 8. (#182)\n- Added `NativeResource` interface and made freeable objects usable as resources in try-with-resources statements. (#186)\n- **Faster thread-local lookups** for the stack and current capabilities. New options in Configuration can be used to **complete eliminate** thread-local lookup in OpenGL, OpenGL ES and OpenAL, when it is known that only a single context will be used, or that all contexts will be compatible (same capabilities and same function pointers).\n- Added `memSlice` for all buffers types in `MemoryUtil`. (#179)\n- Refactored the `Configuration` class for type safety and added more options.\n- **JDK 9** can now be used to build and run LWJGL.\n- Javadoc is now generated with JDK 9. The API is fully indexed and **search** functionality is available. Also made multiple Javadoc formatting improvements.\n- Improved debug diagnostics on startup and when loading the LWJGL shared library fails.\n- Optimized `memSet` and `memCopy` for small buffers.\n\n**FIXES**\n- **Stopped** using **UPX** compression for binaries. This eliminates various integration issues and virus scanning false-positives.\n- The `SharedLibraryLoader` now works with any shared library, not only libraries LWJGL knows about. (#176)\n\n**BREAKING CHANGES**\n- LWJGL now requires **Java 8** to build and run. Certain custom interfaces have been replaced with `java.util.function` interfaces. (#177)\n- **Dropped** support for **Linux x86**. (#162)\n- **Dropped** libffi bindings.\n- **Dropped** `ALDevice/ALContext` wrappers from OpenAL and `CLPlatform/CLDevice` wrappers from OpenCL. (#152)\n- **Dropped** the `getInstance()` method from bindings loaded from shared libraries. Function pointers are now stored either in capabilities classes or in a nested **Functions** inner class.\n- **Dropped** infrequently used method overloads in bindings. Full javadoc is now generated on (almost) all overloads.\n- **Dropped** utility classes that were not useful.\n- Added **AutoSize** support to **struct members**. Instance setters for the corresponding count/size members were removed to avoid bugs and confusion.\n- Replaced `MemoryUtil.memFree(StructBuffer)` with `StructBuffer.free()`.\n- Renamed `__ALIGNMENT` to `ALIGNOF` in struct classes.\n- Removed `org.lwjgl.system.Retainable` interface. `Closure` and `FunctionProvider` subclasses are now destroyed using `.free()` instead of `.release()`.\n- Moved **xxHash** and **SSE** bindings to the `org.lwjgl.util` package.\n- Integer-boolean native types (0 or 1 are the only legal values) are now mapped to Java booleans. (#181)\n- **Macros** without parameters are now generated as static final values, not methods.\n"}

There were several API changes, especially to struct and callback classes.\n- Moved advanced functionality from the base package to the [system](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/tree/master/modules/core/src/main/java/org/lwjgl/system) package. Public API in the system package may change between releases.\n- Critical methods have been optimized for better performance and garbage elimination.\n- JNI methods are now [deduplicated](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3-generated/blob/master/java/org/lwjgl/system/JNI.java) and struct layout is calculated in Java. This means much smaller shared libraries.\n- Introduced the [Configuration](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/blob/master/modules/core/src/main/java/org/lwjgl/system/Configuration.java) class that can be used to programmatically configure LWJGL.\n- Introduced explicit memory management API, which is also used internally by LWJGL.\n- Introduced a debug allocator that can be enabled for the explicit memory management API. It reports memory leaks with full stack-traces to the leaked allocations.\n- All struct classes now have a corresponding [StructBuffer](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/blob/master/modules/core/src/main/java/org/lwjgl/system/StructBuffer.java) implementation. Bindings now use Struct and StructBuffer parameters and return values, instead of ByteBuffer, which improves type safety.\n- Struct fields and accessors are now documented.\n- Many other fixes and minor features.\n\nChanges to bindings:\n- Removed obsolete OS-specific bindings.\n- Added bindings to many OpenGL extensions that were missing in 3.0.0a.\n- Added bindings to [jemalloc](http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/).\n- Added bindings to [EGL](https://www.khronos.org/egl).\n- Added bindings to [OpenGL ES](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/).\n- Added bindings to [xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash).\n- The bindings to [LibOVR](https://developer.oculus.com/) were updated to 0.8.0.0 and are now included in the official build.\n- Several other fixes and updates to existing bindings.\n"}
