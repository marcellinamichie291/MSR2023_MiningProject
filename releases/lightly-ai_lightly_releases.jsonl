This means e.g. that if a subfolder without read permissions is encountered, a `PermissionError` will be raised instead of silently ignoring the subfolder.\r\n- When embedding, the order of the embeddings in the output will now be the order of the samples in the dataset, even if multiple workers are used in the dataloader. Thus also the embeddings in the embedding file are in the sorted order. This is not directly a bugfix but might prevent problems later on. \r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n- The usage of resnet backbones in the example models is now consistent. Thanks for bringing this up @JeanKaddour!\r\n- The SimCLR example now does not use Gaussian blur anymore, just like in the paper. Thanks for pointing this out @littleolex!\r\n- The BarlowTwins example now also uses an input size of 32 to make it consistent with the other examples. Thanks for bringing this up @heytitle!\r\n- The documentation for setting up Azure as cloud storage for the Lightly Platform has been improved. \r\n## Models\r\n- [Bootstrap your own latent: A new approach to self-supervised Learning, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733)\r\n- [Barlow Twins: Self-Supervised Learning via Redundancy Reduction, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03230)\r\n- [SimSiam: Exploring Simple Siamese Representation Learning, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10566)\r\n- [MoCo: Momentum Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722)\r\n- [SimCLR: A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709)\r\n- [NNCLR: Nearest-Neighbor Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations, 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14548.pdf)\r\n- [SwAV: Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features by Contrasting Cluster Assignments, M.

E.g. you can define your own model out of blocks like a backbone, projection head, momentum encoder, nearest neighbour memory bank and more. \r\nWe want you to see easily how the models in current papers are build and that different papers often only differ in one or two of these blocks.\r\nCompatible examples of all models are shown in the benchmarking scripts for [imagenette](https://github.com/lightly-ai/lightly/blob/master/docs/source/getting_started/benchmarks/imagenette_benchmark.py) and [cifar10](https://github.com/lightly-ai/lightly/blob/master/docs/source/getting_started/benchmarks/cifar10_benchmark.py).\r\n\r\nAs part of this refactoring to improve flexibility of the framework we have added a deprecation warning to all old models under `lightly/models`, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe high-level building block NNCLR will be deprecated in version 1.2.0. \r\nUse low-level building blocks instead. \r\nSee https://docs.lightly.ai/lightly.models.html for more information\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese models will be removed with the upcoming version 1.2. The necessity of the refactoring stems from a lack of flexibility which makes it difficult to keep up with the latest publications.\r\n\r\n## SwAV Model\r\nLightly now supports the [Swapping assignment between views (SWaV) paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09882). Thanks to the new system with building blocks, we could implement it more easily. \r\n\r\n## S3Bucket Integration\r\n- We added documentation on how to use an S3Bucket as input directory for lightly. It allows you to train your model and create embeddings without needing to download all your data.\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n- When uploading the embeddings to the Lightly Platform, no file `embeddings_sorted.csv` is created anymore, as it was only used internally. We also made the upload of large embeddings files faster. \r\n\r\n## Models\r\n- [Bootstrap your own latent: A new approach to self-supervised Learning, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733)\r\n- [Barlow Twins: Self-Supervised Learning via Redundancy Reduction, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03230)\r\n- [SimSiam: Exploring Simple Siamese Representation Learning, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10566)\r\n- [MoCo: Momentum Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722)\r\n- [SimCLR: A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709)\r\n- [NNCLR: Nearest-Neighbor Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations, 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14548.pdf)\r\n- [SwAV: Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features by Contrasting Cluster Assignments, M.

The new abstractions are easy to understand and \r\ncan be extended to arbitrary projection head implementations - making the framework more flexible. Additionally, the implementation of each projection head is now based on a direct citation from the respective paper. Check it out [here](https://github.com/lightly-ai/lightly/blob/master/lightly/models/modules/heads.py).\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes:**\r\n- The argument `num_mlp_layers` was removed from SimSiam and NNCLR and defaults to 3 (as in the respective papers).\r\n- The projection heads and prediction heads of the models are now separate modules which might break old checkpoints. However, the following function helps loading old checkpoints: [`load_from_state_dict`](https://github.com/lightly-ai/lightly/blob/0af0563e02d55ee8363769a18a1a36d2a1408f64/lightly/cli/_helpers.py#L180)\r\n\r\n## Jigsaw (@shikharmn)\r\nLightly now features the jigsaw augmentation!

Use the strong representations learned in a self-supervised fashion together with model predictions to further improve the data selection process.\r\n\r\nThis release introduces breaking changes with respect to the API calls.\r\n\r\n## Active-Learning\r\nThe self-supervised representations together with the model predictions provide a great basis for deciding which samples should be annotated and which ones are redundant.\r\n\r\nThis release brings a completely new interface with which you can add active-learning to your ML project with just a few lines of code.:\r\n\r\n- ApiWorkflowClient: `lightly.api.api_workflow_client.ApiWorkflowClient`\r\n    The ApiWorkflowClient is used to connect to our API. The API handles the selection of the images based on embeddings and active- learning scores. To initialize the ApiWorkflowClient, you will need the datasetId and the token from the Lightly Platform.\r\n- ActiveLearningAgent: `lightly.active_learning.agents.agent.ActiveLearningAgent`\r\n    The ActiveLearningAgent builds the client interface of our active-learning framework. It helps with indicating which images are preselected and which ones to sample from. Furthermore, one can query it to get a new batch of images. To initialize an ActiveLearningAgent you need an ApiWorkflowClient.\r\n- SamplerConfig: `lightly.active_learning.config.sampler_config.SamplerConfig`\r\n    The SamplerConfig allows the configuration of a sampling request. In particular, you can set the number of samples, the name of the resulting selection, and the SamplingMethod. Currently, you can set the SamplingMethod to one of the following:\r\n    - Random: Selects samples uniformly at random.\r\n    - Coreset: Selects samples that are diverse.\r\n    - Coral: Combines Coreset with scores to do active-learning.\r\n- Scorer: `lightly.active_learning.scorers.scorer.Scorer`\r\n    The Scorer takes as input the predictions of a pre-trained model on the set of unlabeled images. It evaluates different scores based on how certain the model is about the images and passes them to the API so the sampler can use them with Coral.\r\n\r\nCheck out our [documentation](https://docs.lightly.ai/index.html) to learn more!\r\n\r\n## API (breaking)\r\nWith the refactoring of our API, we are switching to using a generated Python client. This leads to clearer and unified endpoints, fewer errors, and better error messages. Unfortunately, this means that previous versions of the package are no longer compatible with our new API.\r\n**Note that this only affects all API calls. Using the package for self-supervised learning is unaffected.**\r\n\r\n## Models\r\n- [SimSiam: Exploring Simple Siamese Representation Learning, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10566)\r\n- [MoCo: Momentum Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722)\r\n- [SimCLR: A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709)"}

The models `SimCLR` and `MoCo`, the `LightlyDataset`, and the `BaseCollateFunction` were refactored. These changes were necessary to make the code base better understandable.\r\n\r\n## SimSiam (@busycalibrating)\r\nAn implementation of the [SimSiam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10566) self-supervised framework is introduced. It relies on a siamese network architecture and aims to maximize similarity between two augmentations of one image.\r\n\r\n## Refactoring: LightlyDataset\r\nThe `LightlyDataset` is refactored such that the constructor now always expects an input directory `input_dir` which indicates where the images are stored. To use a `LightlyDataset` with any PyTorch dataset, the class method `LightlyDataset.from_torch_dataset` can be used.\r\n\r\n**1.0.7 (incompatible)**\r\n```python \r\n>>> dataset = LightlyDataset(from_folder='path/to/data')\r\n>>>\r\n>>> dataset = LightlyDataset(root='./', name='cifar10', download=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**1.0.8**\r\n```python\r\n>>> dataset = LightlyDataset(input_dir='path/to/data')\r\n>>>\r\n>>> torch_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./', download=True)\r\n>>> dataset = LightlyDataset.from_torch_dataset(torch_dataset)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Refactoring: BaseCollateFunction\r\nThe `BaseCollateFunction` now returns a tuple of augmented image batches along with the labels and filenames `(aug0, aug1), labels, filenames` where `aug0` and `aug1` are both of shape `bsz x channels x H x W`.\r\n\r\n## Refactoring: SimCLR, MoCo and NTXentLoss\r\nIn accordance with the changes of the `BaseCollateFunction`, `SimCLR` and `MoCo` will expect the augmented images seperately now instead of as a single batch. Similarly, the `NTXentLoss` now requires a separate batch of representations as inputs.\r\n\r\n**1.0.7 (incompatible)**\r\n```python\r\n>>> # batch size is 128\r\n>>> batch, labels, filenames = next(iter(dataloader))\r\n>>> batch.shape\r\ntorch.Size([256, 3, 32, 32]) \r\n>>> # number of features is 64\r\n>>> y = simclr(batch)\r\n>>> y.shape\r\ntorch.Size([256, 64])\r\n>>> loss = ntx_ent_loss(y)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**1.0.8**\r\n```python\r\n>>> # batch size is 128\r\n>>> (batch0, batch1), labels, filenames = next(iter(dataloader))\r\n>>> batch0.shape\r\ntorch.Size([128, 3, 32, 32])    \r\n>>> batch1.shape\r\ntorch.Size([128, 3, 32, 32]) \r\n>>> # number of features is 64\r\n>>> y0, y1 = simclr(batch0, batch1)\r\n>>> y0.shape\r\ntorch.Size([128, 64])\r\n>>> y1.shape\r\ntorch.Size([128, 64])\r\n>>> loss = ntx_ent_loss(y0, y1)\r\n```\r\n## Documentation Updates\r\nA tutorial about how to use the SimSiam model is added along with some minor changes and improvements.\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\nPrivate functions are hidden from autocompletion.\r\n\r\n## Models\r\n- [SimSiam: Exploring Simple Siamese Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10566)\r\n- [MoCo: Momentum Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722)\r\n- [SimCLR: A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709)\r\n"}
