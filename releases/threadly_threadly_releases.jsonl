Because of that the `boolean` to define the mode is no longer accepted.  If you previously were passing a `false` for this argument it can be simply removed.  If recurring execution is needed this can be hacked in easily (and is done within the library in our compatibility layer).\r\n* One of `ConfigurableThreadFactory`'s constructors has been removed, supplying an additional `null` argument at the end will match 6.X's functionality.\r\n* The above constructor change also was done to `ThreadReferencingThreadFactory`.  Supplying an additional `null` argument at the end will match 6.X's functionality.\r\n* `SameThreadSubmitterExecutor` can no longer be constructed.  Internal optimizations require the use of `SameThreadSubmitterExecutor.instance()`\r\n* In `Profiler` invocations of `dump` where specifying if individual threads should be included have been removed.  Now an additional argument must be specified for the minimum number of times a stack had to be witnessed before it was reported, allowing an even more concise output.  Specifying an argument of `1` at the end will match 6.X's functionality.\r\n* `UnsafeAccess` was removed to comply with JDK 17 support\r\n\r\nThe above is summarized in our migration guide: https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Major-version-migration-guide#6x---7x\r\n\r\nFeel free to join our Zulip chat or file an issue if you need help with migration"}

release:\r\n* `org.threadly.test.concurrent` package has been moved to a new artifact at the maven coordinates `org.threadly:threadly-test:1.0`.\r\n\r\n* `BlockingQueueConsumer` was replaced with a potentially more performant `Poller.consumeQueue` or a more direct replacement `org.threadly.concurrent.processing.BlockingQueueConsumer`\r\n\r\n* `CentralThreadlyPool.lowPriorityPool(boolean)`  was replaced with either `CentralThreadlyPool.lowPrioritySingleThreadPool()` or `CentralThreadlyPool.lowPriorityPool()` \r\n\r\n* `DoNothingRunnable` can not be constructed, instead `DoNothingRunnable.instance()` should be used.\r\n\r\n* `RunnableCallableAdapter` can not be constructed, instead the static function `RunnableCallableAdapter.adapt` should be used.\r\n\r\n* `RunnableChain` was moved to the package `org.threadly.concurrent.wrapper`\r\n\r\n* `AbstractFutureCallbackFailureHandler` was removed, instead use `ListenableFuture.failureCallback(Consumer)`\r\n\r\n* `AbstractFutureCallbackResultHandler` was removed, instead use `ListenableFuture.resultCallback(Consumer)`\r\n\r\n* `FutureCallbackExceptionHandlerAdapter` was removed, instead use `ListenableFuture.failureCallback(Consumer)` (which allows an `ExceptionHandler` to be passed in)\r\n\r\n* `FutureCallbackFailureHandler` was removed, instead use `ListenableFuture.failureCallback(Consumer)`\r\n\r\n* `FutureCallbackResultHandler` was removed, instead use `ListenableFuture.resultCallback(Consumer)`\r\n\r\n* `FutureUtils.scheduleWhileTaskResultNull` was removed, instead just implement a small Predicate with a `null` check and use `FutureUtils.scheduleWhile`\r\n\r\n* `Watchdog` was renamed and moved to `org.threadly.concurrent.future.watchdog.ConstantTimeWatchdog`\r\n\r\n* `WatchdogCache` was renamed and moved to `org.threadly.concurrent.future.watchdog.MixedTimeWatchdog`\r\n\r\n* `RunnableFutureCallbackAdapter` was removed without replacement (more precise and performant lambda options are used now)\r\n\r\n* `ListenableScheduledFuture` interface was removed without replacement\r\n\r\n* `ScheduledFutureDelegate` was removed without replacement\r\n\r\n* `StripedLock` was removed without replacement\r\n\r\n* A variety of deprecated constructors were replaced, see 5.43 javadocs for details on how to migrate to a still supported constructor\r\n\r\nWe decided to keep this release smaller by limiting the scope to currently exclude:\r\n\r\n* A JVM upgrade will NOT be included, still allowing java 8 and newer.\r\n\r\n* Deeper API considerations previously planned for 6.0 are going to be pushed to potentially a 7.0 release.\r\n"}

Notable performance improvements when comparing against a low priority task for execution, combined with a couple other more minor improvements.\r\n\r\n* JVM bug fix with LockSupport use: https://github.com/threadly/threadly/commit/d792e4fd1b4052691869fb2e073cc8628381ce07\r\n\r\n* gradle wrapper updated"}

In addition we can also deprecate `FutureCallbackExceptionHandlerAdapter` since `ExceptionHandler` already extends `Consumer<Throwable>`, allowing them to be provided directly into `failureCallback`.\r\n  \r\n* Added statics to `ImmediateResultListenableFuture`:\r\n  - `EMPTY_STRING_RESULT` provides the `String` `\"\"`\r\n  - `EMPTY_OPTIONAL_RESULT` provides `Optional.empty()`\r\n  - `EMPTY_LIST_RESULT` provides `Collections.emptyList()`\r\n  - `EMPTY_MAP_RESULT` provides `Collections.emptyMap()`\r\n  - `EMPTY_SORTED_MAP_RESULT` provides `Collections.emptySortedMap()`\r\n  - `EMPTY_SET_RESULT` provides `Collections.emptySet()`\r\n  - `EMPTY_SORTED_SET_RESULT` provides `Collections.emptySortedSet()`\r\n  - `EMPTY_ITERATOR_RESULT` provides `Collections.emptyIterator()`\r\n  - `EMPTY_LIST_ITERATOR_RESULT` provides `Collections.emptyListIterator()`\r\n  - `EMPTY_ENUMERATION_RESULT` provides `Collections.emptyEnumeration()`\r\n\r\n* `FutureUtils.immediateResultFuture` will now provide the above static's for the cases of `Optional.empty()`, `Boolean.TRUE/FALSE`, and the empty `String`.  Other cases are still not optimized due to impact seen in benchmarks.\r\n\r\n* Improvements to `FutureUtils` when an empty Collection is provided.  The resulting future now being the `EMPTY_LIST_RESULT` result described above."}

running thread while the predicate is tested, allowing for more accurate `getRunningStack()` results / debugging\r\n* `FutureUtils.executeWhile` will return the running stack of the async future returned from the callable if it's running\r\n* `FutureUtils.executeWhile` and `FutureUtils.scheduleWhile` now correctly will propagate cancellations on the returned future to the delegate future which is processing the result.

includes a variety of improvements to the utility `Profiler`:\r\n* Thread names are checked at polling time, so if threads are renamed we will try to indicate the different names we witnessed\r\n* Profiled threads are now sorted by their name, hopefully grouping similar threads together\r\n* Common stack traces (like idle `PriorityScheduler` threads for example) are now simplified in `Profiler` output\r\n* Minor performance improvements and memory usage reductions\r\n\r\nOther improvements:\r\n* `TestCondition` was improved to allow a `Supplier<T>` / `Predicate<T>` constructor, so that on failure the last result / condition can be reported\r\n* `ListenableFuture.mapFailure` generics improvements.  Not likely to be realized except for in very specific situations.\r\n\r\nOther changes / deprecations:\r\n* `StripedLock` is deprecated for removal (if you want this maintained in 6.0 please open an issue).  PR #239 and #240 removed our internal use of it by instead using `Map.compute` as a way of doing per-key memory barriers.  Feel free to open an issue if you want to discuss maintaining it.  Current thoughts are that those changes are likely simpler (despite the complexity of capturing results from inside `compute` blocks).  This also resulted in several constructors where an estimated `parallismLevel` could be specified in being deprecated.  As those PR's show other internal (but otherwise should be transparent) changes were done to support this.\r\n* `DoNothingRunnable` should no longer be constructed, but instead referenced by `DoNothingRunnable.instance()`\r\n* `KeyedRateLimiterExecutor` no longer schedules a task per key.  Instead it has a single task to examine all keys.  This may result in limiters living a bit longer, but should overall perform better under heavy load."}

This is similar to `scheduleWhile` except that execution happens immediately.  No pool is even needed to be passed here, as we can jump our execution off from the previous `ListenableFuture`.\r\n\r\nDeprecations:\r\n* `FutureUtils.scheduleWhileTaskResultNull` has been deprecated without replacement.  Transitioning to provide a `Predicate` like `(o) -> o != null` seems like an easy transition.  Having this specific variation would otherwise result in a proliferation of the api and might make things confusing.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n* A reduction in the stack sizes produced when using threadly monads.  If mapping a future multiple times it can result in a very large stack size.  This still true, but it's size should be reduced by between 1/4 and 1/3 what it was in 5.15."}

So `throwMap` was added to provide the pre-5.10 behavior of `map`.  Specifically `throwMap` expects exceptions to be thrown from the mapper function so that it can translate the future into a failure state. \r\n* Improvements to GC when executor optimizations are used"}

By removing this need you no longer need to worry about the thread pool lifecycle (no shutting down these pools).  And in addition you are providing the central pool the ability to try and reduce thread churn across the application.  Pools returned from this may incur some additional (minor) overhead in task execution, but nothing that should be significant.  For high throughput, and long lived / high usage pools, you may not want to replace them with this, but there is the potential to do so if you prefer.\r\n\r\n* `ExecutorLimiter` now has the capabilities of no longer limiting monad / listener functionality.  When you add a listener without an executor (or a `map` function), that listener will invoke on the thread which completed the task execution as well.  This means that the `Limiter` will also restrict during those actions.  This change allows you to allow the limiter to release the limit as soon as the core task completes, not counting listener / monad functions against the limit.  You can gain this new behavior by using the new constructor and specifying `false` for the `limitFutureListenersExecution`\r\n\r\n* Added `SingleThreadSchedulerSubPool` as a possibly more efficient alternative to other Limiter's when you want to limit it down to a single thread.  This also is the only limiter that provides `TaskPriority` handling logic.  However it does have some different behavior characteristics compared to other limiters (for example in how it tries to steal delegate pool cpu time as long as necessary to get all tasks completed, rather than needing to be individually queued against the parent scheduler).\r\n\r\n* Added `ThreadRenamingPriorityScheduler`.  This is similar to other `ThreadRenaming` schedulers/executors, but implements the `PrioritySchedulerService` interface."}

This can happen just simple things like blocking on a future, or using a ReentrantLock.\r\nThe solution is just to reset the state once we know the thread is within our control before we park.  The best place for this seems to before we queue the thread as parked.\r\n\r\nLots of benchmarking occured in this change since this does reduce the original benefit.  In fact the advantage to no optimization at all is minor at best.  I suspect this might be a place for further optimization in the future.  Right now it does make sense to reduce the unparks due to the seperate peek / remove time (don't want threads wasting time inspecting tasks they can't execute).  A global check shows benefit in some use cases but worst in others.  In contrast an aggressive unpark (like searching for a parked thread) also shows benefit in some cases more than others.  This current solution is currently designed to be a safe compromise."}

The most notable single change is the drop in support for java 6 and 7.  However with that we have been able to make internal and ergonomic improvements for java 8 and newer users.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations that were removed:\r\n* `AbstractDelayed` removed without replacement\r\n\r\n* `PrioritySchedulerLimiter` removed without replacement\r\n\r\n* Interface deprecations/removals\r\n  - `SubmitterExecutorInterface` -> `SubmitterExecutor`\r\n  - `SimpleSchedulerInterface` -> `SchedulerService`\r\n  - `SchedulerServiceInterface` -> `SchedulerService`\r\n  - `PrioritySchedulerInterface` -> `PrioritySchedulerService`\r\n  - `RunnableContainerInterface` -> `RunnableContainer`\r\n\r\n* `org.threadly.concurrent.PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker` was replaced with `org.threadly.concurrent.statistics.PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker`\r\n\r\n* `StringUtils.NEW_LINE` was removed since in JDK 1.7 and newer `System.lineSeparator()` can be a direct replacement.\r\n\r\n* Wrappers moved into wrapper package (with additional sub packages to keep things easier to find)\r\n\r\n* ExecutorWrapper renamed into SubmitterExecutorAdapter (longer but more descriptive).\r\n\r\n* PrioritySchedulerWrapper was replaced with PrioritySchedulerDefaultPriorityWrapper\r\n\r\n* Thread renaming wrapper classes deprecated and renamed to be brief (without loosing clarity):\r\n  - `ThreadRenamingExecutorWrapper` -> `ThreadRenamingExecutor`\r\n  - `ThreadRenamingRunnableWrapper` -> `ThreadRenamingRunnable`\r\n  - `ThreadRenamingSchedulerServiceWrapper` -> `ThreadRenamingSchedulerService`\r\n  - `ThreadRenamingSubmitterSchedulerWrapper` -> `ThreadRenamingSubmitterScheduler`\r\n\r\n*  `ChainedRunnableListenableFuture` and `ClearOnGetSettableListenableFuture` were removed without replacement.  These classes were hard to use correctly, and only useful in very limited situations (and with improved pool benchmarks those situations are even fewer than before).  If anyone has a use for these classes open a github issue.  I feel like there could be some alternative implementations which are simpler and better (but only want to provide such a thing if there is a need).\r\n\r\n* Many function name changes:\r\n * `StringUtils.randomString` (now use `makeRandomString`)\r\n * `StringUtils.makeNonNull` (now use `nullToEmpty`)\r\n\r\n* Thread `Profiler` can no longer be constructed with output dump file\r\n\r\n## Improvements added to 5.0:\r\n* Significant Javadoc formatting improvements\r\n\r\n* Performance improvements from being able to leverage java 8 added functionality\r\n\r\n* Added Monads to `ListenableFuture`.  See `ListenableFuture.map` and `ListenableFuture.flatMap`.  \r\n\r\n* In addition `FutureUtils.scheduleWhile` provides a nice way to have an async looping operation.\r\n\r\n* Added `Poller` as a way to poll for state (through Supplier, or `java.util.concurrent.Future` result), with a `ListenableFuture` returned as a way to be notified when the state changes.\r\n\r\n* Ergonomics improvements with the use of java 8 (included but not limited to task interceptors, `TestCondition`, `Pair`).\r\n\r\n* `Pair` now also has additional features for transforming collections of pairs.\r\n\r\n* `ListenerHelper` and `InvokationTee` updated to handle `default` interface functions which return a result.\r\n\r\n## Internal improvements in 5.0:\r\n* Performance and memory usage improvements to stripedLock (typically just used internally)\r\n\r\n* An exception is handled when `AbstractService` is garbage collected without being stopped\r\n\r\n* `ReschedulingOperation` has a fix for a potential state while going through individual if condition checks.\r\n\r\n* `PriorityScheduler` has performance improvements where unnecessary `unpark` calls are reduced."}

`java.util.concurrent.Future` into a threadly `ListenableFuture`.

Similar to other queue limiting wrappers, this one is just for the `PrioritySchedulerService`\n- Limiter wrappers: Instead of only throwing `RejectedExecutionException`'s we now can accept a `RejectedExecutionHandler` in order to perform other actions.  By default we still throw `RejectedExecutionException`.\n- Moved `getQueuedTaskCount(TaskPriority)` definition from AbstractPriorityScheduler and into the `PrioritySchedulerService` interface.  Thus allowing you to still have access to this priority specific functionality while passing around the interface.\n- Added `SuppressedStackRuntimeException`.  This exception type can be extended to prevent stack generation (which can be expensive in java).\n- Added `ExceptionUtils.makeRuntime(Throwable, boolean)` which allows you to use the above new wrapper exception type to avoid stack generation.\n- Added `Pair.split` which is equivalent (but more efficient) than invoking `Pair.collectLeft` and `Pair.collectRight`.  `Pair.split` takes a collection of Pair's and returns a single pair that contains two collections (one for the left side, one for the right side).\n- Added ability for `RateLimiterExecutor` and `KeyedRateLimiterExecutor` to at construction time accept a maximum delay, and start to reject tasks if they are too backed up.  This seems like a common need, and while it can be done externally to this class, it's annoying and less efficient.\n- RateLimiterExecutor: In execute that accepts permits we now return the milliseconds the task was delayed.  We can't always do this because in all other cases we are implementing an interface or already returning a future.  But this one condition is at least a little more flexible now.\n\n## Deprecations:\n- Deprecated for 5.0.0 removal `StringUtils.NEW_LINE`.  In JDK 1.7 and newer `System.lineSeparator()` can be a perfect replacement.\n- ExecutorWrapper renamed into SubmitterExecutorAdapter (longer but more descriptive).\n- Thread renaming wrapper classes deprecated and renamed to be brief (without loosing clarity):\n  -   `ThreadRenamingExecutorWrapper` -> `ThreadRenamingExecutor`\n  -   `ThreadRenamingRunnableWrapper` -> `ThreadRenamingRunnable`\n  -   `ThreadRenamingSchedulerServiceWrapper` -> `ThreadRenamingSchedulerService`\n  -   `ThreadRenamingSubmitterSchedulerWrapper` -> `ThreadRenamingSubmitterScheduler`\n-  `ChainedRunnableListenableFuture` and `ClearOnGetSettableListenableFuture` were deprecated without replacement.  These classes were hard to use correctly, and only useful in very limited situations (and with improved pool benchmarks those situations are even fewer than before).  If anyone has a use for these classes open a github issue.  I feel like there could be some alternative implementations which are simpler and better (but only want to provide such a thing if there is a need).\n- `SubmitterSchedulerQueueLimitRejector` deprecated `getCurrentQueueSize()` for `getQueuedTaskCount()`.  This is a more consistent name with the rest of the library.\n"}

This takes in a collection of futures, and will add a listener to each one so that if any fail in failure then will all be canceled.  This is a common pattern to avoid doing unnecessary work when you need the results from multiple individual tasks.\n- Performance improvements with `makeFailureListFuture` and `makeResultListFuture` when provided lots of canceled futures.  If using `FutureUtils.cancelIncompleteFutures` on a large collection of futures, and then using `makeFailureListFuture` or `makeResultListFuture` would result in a lot of unnecessarily load as we optimistically try to pull the results from the canceled futures.  Instead we check for this condition to avoid having an exception constructed and thrown as a way of communicating the state.\n- Behavior improvement when future canceled from FutureUtils.makeResultListFuture.  Previously if a future was canceled this would be treated just like any other error, potentially resulting in the returned future throwing an ExecutionException.  Worse yet this canceled future may have hidden a more interesting error from one of the futures.  Now if one or more futures are canceled, but NO futures end in error, then the returned future will also be canceled.  If one or more futures is canceled, but at least one future IS in error, then we will ignore the canceled conditions and fail the returned future with the more interesting failure.  This is a huge benefit in traceability for issues.\n"}

It does deprecate a lot of things due to these package moves.  However hopefully it will make the javadocs easier to explore.  Since threadly is heavily built on this idea of \"wrapping\" pools, it makes sense to have a \"wrapper\" package which you can find these wrappers from.\n\nImprovements included in this release:\n- Added ability to intercept tasks before they are added to the pool by using wrappers in `org.threadly.concurrent.wrapper.intercepter`\n- Added ExceptionUtils hasCauseOfType and getCauseOfType, which provides easy ways to determine if an exception chain at some point had a specific exception type included.  This can be used for creating more robust error handling, or for shortening exception stacks.\n- Minor performance improvements for NoThreadScheduler (which in turn will improve SingleThreadScheduler)\n- Minor performance improvements with Clock updater thread.  We now avoid updating the clock if it was naturally updated anyways.  This should reduce the kernel overhead even further (but not by a ton since it only happened 10 times a second anyways).  One thing that makes threadly unique is our very few system clock call invocations, and this only furthers that design idea.\n- Internal code duplication reductions between NoThreadScheduler and PriorityScheduler\n\nDeprecations / class moves in this release:\n- Deprecated `ListUtils`, this will have a replacement in 5.0.0 called `SortUtils`.  This new implementation will have much cleaner interfaces.\n- Deprecated `ListenerHelper.build()`, `AsyncListenerHelper.build()` and `DefaultExecutorListenerHelper.build()`.

An executor (no scheduling) that is designed to provide less guarantees, but as much performance as possible.  If planning to use it please read the javadocs carefully.\n- Improved \"Pair\" `collectLeft` and `collectRight` API to be more forgiving with incoming generics (no functional changes needed)\n- Added \"StatisticsUtils\" for both internal and external help around getting basic statistics\n- Added \"ExecutorStatisticWrapper\", while the PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker is still a better option for statistics from the PriorityScheduler.  This is the start of being able to wrap schedulers to get basic statistics from any arbitrary executor.\n- Added \"NoThreadSchedulerStatisticTracker\" and \"SingleThreadSchedulerStatisticTracker\" to complete options of possible statistic trackers.  These follow the more common api specified in the above statistic trackers.\n\nBug fixes:\n- Fixed issue in ExecutorQueueLimitRejector and SubmitterSchedulerQueueLimitRejector where if the parent (wrapped) scheduler/executor throws a RejectedExecutionException the queue count would be forever too large.\n- Sort of a bug fix, I consider the behavior unexpected (or at a minimum undesired).  When removing a Future task from PriorityScheduler, NoThreadScheduler, or SingleThreadScheduler it would cancel the future (without an interrupt).  This is the same if removing from `.remove(Task)` or `.shutdownNow()`.  This behavior has been changed, so that futures will be left untouched.  Allowing the user to manually cancel them (possibly with FutureUtils), or possibly re-execute them on another scheduler.\n\nDeprecations (to be removed in 5.0.0):\n- Deprecated \"PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker\" at old location, and created a new one located at org.threadly.concurrent.statistics.PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker\n- Deprecated in the \"SchedulerService\" interface `getCurrentRunningCount` for the shorter and better named `getActiveTaskCount`.  This is more consistent, closer to what is in java.util (so hopefully easier to find in the docs), and shorter in name.\n- Deprecated in the \"SchedulerService\" interface `getScheduledTaskCount` for the shorter and better named `getQueuedTaskCount`.  This is more consistent and a bit shorter in name.\n- Deprecated in \"SingleThreadScheduler\" `shutdownAndAwaitTermination`, `shutdownAndAwaitTermination`, `shutdownNowAndAwaitTermination`  .Instead replacing them with the more common `awaitTermination()` and `awaitTermination(long)`.\n- Deprecated KeyDistributedExecutor's `getSubmitterForKey` to be renamed into `getExecutorForKey`\n- Similar to above KeyDistributedScheduler's `getSubmitterSchedulerForKey` has been renamed to `getSchedulerForKey`\n"}

This is most notable in our ScheduledExecutorService Wrapper's.  Historically in threadly when you cancel a future it ends up being a no-op task once executed (but not removed from execution).  Because ScheduledExecutorService returns futures for recurring tasks (which otherwise threadly does not support), if you cancel that future it just ends up being a no-op each time it executes.  This patch release changes that behavior so that those ScheduledExecutorService wrappers will remove the task when a recurring task's future is canceled.\n\nThe threadly implementations still do the more performant option of just letting the task become a no-op when canceled, and if removal is desired you must explicitly remove the task.  However we did change the shutdownNow behavior of SingleThreadScheduler and PriorityScheduler so that it wont return canceled tasks in its list of tasks waiting for execution.\n"}

It now operates with one less thread, the thread used for managing queues is now removed, and instead that work is done by all the pools threads as they become idle.  This was a difficult change, because one motivation was to reduce the locking that must occur, and reduce the thread boundaries a task must pass through.  This meant that code that previously was only operated on in a single threaded way, must become thread safe (without locking).  It was months in the making, but ultimately we got a reliable solution.  The best part, it's way faster.  We don't have ongoing benchmarks posted yet (also in the works), but the change is really quite impressive.  Depending on your use case, you can see anywhere from 45% on up performance improvement in task execution rate.  In every case blowing the java.util scheduler out of the water.\n- Improved/fixed issue where RunnableListenerHelper would invoke added listeners while holding a lock if the helper has already completed.  This improves the handling of listeners for all ListenableFuture's.\n- Added AbstractFutureCallbackFailureHandler, AbstractFutureCallbackResultHandler, FutureCallbackExceptionHandlerAdapter.  These implementations are just to reduce boiler plate code.  Allowing you to create FutureCallback implementations which care for just the result, or just the failure condition.\n- Added tuple classes \"Pair\" and \"MutablePair\".  I find myself wanting these from time to time, the latest being in ambush.  So I added them as a little utility class.\n- Switched RunnableListenerHelper and ListenerHelper to use a list of \"Pair's\" described above instead of a HashMap.  This has a sizable improvement of both listener add time, and the amount of heap used.  Though it does mean if a listener is added multiple times it will be invoked multiple times (where previously just the last addition was used).  Please see the discussion on #177 for more information, and the change can be seen in PR #179.\n- Added Clock.accurateNanoTime() and Clock.lastKnownNanoTime().  Allowing access to the stored nano time without the conversion to milliseconds.\n- Improved ExecutorService wrappers for invokeAll when no timeout is provided, we now avoid clock calls during that case.\n\nFixes:\n- Fixed issue where sending a thread interrupt to a unit test thread can cause TestCondition to spin loop (without parking).\n- Improved ability to run unit tests reliably on slow systems\n\nDeprecations:\n- Deprecated Clock.systemNanoTime, instead use Clock.accurateNanoTime\n- Deprecated AbstractDelayed.  Since this abstract implementation has no meaningful value inside threadly, and because it likely only would have value to other pool developers it does not seem worth the jar size.  If anyone is actually using this let me know via a github issue and lets discuss.\n- Deprecated (Abstract)PriorityScheduler.makeWithDefaultPriority.  We are trying to stop sprinkling these helper/wrapper functions everywhere.  Instead to keep things more concise and uniform you should manually wrap the scheduler in a PrioritySchedulerDefaultPriorityWrapper\n"}

This has several ways which invocations can be distributed to the provided instances.\n- NoThreadScheduler, SingleThreadScheduler, and TestableScheduler now implement the PrioritySchedulerInterface (and thus have an extension of functionality to include and handle different priorities for tasks)\n- Added new \"TaskPriority\" \"Starvable\"...this priority is below \"Low\" and in fact will only run when the scheduler has absolutely nothing else it can run.  Thus these tasks can be starved if the scheduler never becomes idle.\n- Added ExecutorQueueLimitRejector, SubmitterSchedulerQueueLimitRejector and SchedulerServiceQueueLimitRejector...these classes allow you to wrap an executor or scheduler and track how many tasks have been passed through the limiter, and are waiting for execution to start.  If the queue gets too large this will throw RejectedExecutionExceptions.  This is designed to be a more flexible solution than providing a limit sized queue into java.util.concurrent's schedulers.\n- Added ThreadRenamingRunnableWrapper, ThreadRenamingExecutorWrapper, ThreadRenamingSubmitterSchedulerWrapper, and ThreadRenamingSubmitterSchedulerWrapper...these implementations simply rename the thread as configured (either replaced or just prefixed to), and then once execution is complete reset the thread names to what it was originally.\n- Some functionality in \"PriorityScheduler\" has been moved to the \"PrioritySchedulerService\" interface, so that less will require a handle on the top level reference.\n- getScheduledTaskCount() was added to the \"SchedulerService\" interface.  This was functionality that already existed in the PriorityScheduler, but we wanted to make sure all pools have this easy functionality.\n- added getUnsubmittedTaskCount() to ExecutorLimiter so you can know how far back a limiter is\n- Added \"RunnableCallableAdapter\".  This was primarily for internals of threadly, but allows you to convert a runnable into a callable similar to Executors.callable, but this version also implements the RunnableContainer interface\n- Small default configuration changes for KeyDistributedExecutor to facilitate better performances for most work loads.\n- Interior code improvements to PriorityScheduler\n- (Runnable)ListenerHelper now silently ignores invocations to add null listeners\n- (Runnable)ListenerHelper now has the ability to return a collection of the currently subscribed listeners\n- Added getDelayTillNextTask() into NoThreadScheduler, this is to help allow you to know how long you can block until a task is ready to execute.\n\nDeprecations:\n- TestablePriorityScheduler has been deprecated.  It is no longer needed now that TestableScheduler implements the same API.\n- KeyDistributedExecutor and KeyDistributedScheduler had api changes...in general \"task\" was removed from most task submission, \"addTask\" has been replaced with the more familiar \"execute\" name\n- Deprecated PrioritySchedulerLimiter.  It does not make sense limiting mixed priorities of tasks for reasons I discuss here: https://github.com/threadly/threadly/commit/8ea220cbca0b8530fcf9ebee9be362ac7d025b44 ...As an alternative I recommend wrapping a PriorityScheduler in a PrioritySchedulerWrapper to set a default priority, then put that inside a SchedulerServiceLimiter.\n- Renamed \"SchedulerInterface\" into just \"Scheduler\" (removing the suffix from all interfaces)\n- Renamed (and thus deprecated the old versions) many of the scheduling interfaces:\n  - CallableContainerInterface -> CallableContainer\n  - RunnableContainerInterface -> RunnableContainer\n  - PrioritySchedulerInterface -> PrioritySchedulerService\n  - SchedulerServiceInterface -> SchedulerService\n  - SubmitterExecutorInterface -> SubmitterExecutor\n  - SimpleSchedulerInterface + SubmitterSchedulerInterface -> SubmitterScheduler\n  - ExceptionHandlerInterface -> ExceptionHandler\n- Renamed (and thus deprecated) PrioritySchedulerWrapper into PrioritySchedulerDefaultPriorityWrapper\n"}

I recommend you read the list of changes closely (and file issues if there is any questions).\n- Changed PriorityScheduler behavior so that thread quantities are no longer automatically scaled.  Instead the pool is constructed with a flat size (which is still lazily grown to).  The pool size can be changed still at any point during runtime, but it no longer will move between the core and max pool size.  This does NOT effect the ability to change the pool size manually during runtime.  If you wanted to make your own logic to intelligently size the pool this is still possible.\n- The above changes made it trivial to fix issue #75 where tasks which have been taken for execution, but not actually executed could not be removed.  Thus allowing a better removal of tasks.\n- Because the pool size is no longer dynamic, the behavior of high vs low priority tasks is changed as well.  Now low priority tasks will delay execution if high priority tasks are already waiting (unless they reach their max wait time and are delayed for less than existing high priority tasks).  This continues to ensure that tasks will not be starved, but actually provides a better behavior around low priority tasks (less aggressive).\n- Added new \"Watchdog\" and \"WatchdogCache\" classs which can watch your futures and insure that they complete.  If futures do not complete in time they are canceled.  Thus allowing for lots of timeout implementations as well as guaranteeing completion.\n- Added ability to cancel \"SettableListenableFuture\"'s.  The cancel will never throw an exception, but will only cancel the future if it has not already completed.  In addition you can now set a thread in the SettableListenableFuture to indicate what thread is doing the processing to generate the result.  With this addition, the cancel has the ability to even issue an interrupt to the processing thread.  Once done, this thread reference is removed.\n- \"SettableListenableFuture\"'s can now be constructed with a boolean to indicate if an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown if a result or failure is set after the future has already completed.  The empty constructor defaults to the old behavior (true, it will be thrown), but you can now control it.\n- \"SettableListenableFuture\"'s setResult and setFailure return a boolean now to indicate if that invocation is what completed the future or not...this may be necessary to take advantage of the above change.\n- Added ability to specify a time limit to FutureUtils.blockTillAllComplete and FutureUtils.blockTillAllCompleteOrFirstError\n- Added  FutureUtils.makeResultListFuture(Iteratable<ListenableFuture<T>>) which allows you to easily convert a collection of Futures into a collection of results.\n- Added FutureUtils.countFuturesWithResult implementation.  This iterates over all the provided futures and checks which one's results match with a .equals() check.  This can be useful for API's which return a failed result rather than throw an exception.  Allowing an easy check to know how many resulted in a given result (failure or not, just an example).\n- Added FutureUtils.cancelIncompleteFutures which will iterate over the futures and issue a cancel to any which are not already complete.  Thus ensuring a collection of futures should all be done.\n- Added ability to provide a run time in the Profiler when started.  This will stop the profiler at the time point (and complete a future with the dump results at the time of stop).  This can make it safer to expose the profiler and ensure a limited resource usage.\n- Exposed constant in Clock class to allow a reference to the minimum accuracy of the clock.\n- Removed previously deprecated NoThreadScheduler.tick() which does not have any arguments.  You can simply pass a null in tick now to replicate the old behavior.\n- Removed previously deprecated FutureUtils.addCallback (callbacks should just be added directly on the future)\n- Removed previously deprecated blocking queue implementation (without replacements): DynamicDelayQueue, DynamicDelayedUpdater, and ConsumerIterator\n- Build system improvements, as well as switching from emma to jacoco for code coverage (thus allowing java 8 compiling).\n"}

In 4.X the PriorityScheduler will no longer automatically scale the thread count between the \"core\" and \"max\" count.  Instead it will be constructed with a count, and if you want to adjust it, you must change that set count during runtime (at which point threads will be killed when idle, or created to meet the new set thread goal).  This is still an improvement from java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor, which can not change it's thread count at runtime (despite having the API to do so).  However the change in 4.X will simplify the code, and I am not convinced that the previous feature was not useful to people.\n"}

This class provides static implementations to help in calculating the delay for an absolute time (either minute for the current or next our, or a specific hour/minute within the day).  This can be useful when needing to schedule something (likely with scheduleAtFixedRate) to run at a regular time of day.\n- Reduced locking in NoThreadScheduler (which improves SingleThreadScheduler as well)\n- Added shutdown(Now)AndAwaitTermination feature to SingleThreadScheduler.  This feature allows you to wait till the worker thread joins to the thread issuing the shutdown call (thus ensuring cache coherency)\n- Added hasStopped() to \"AbstractService\".  This will be false while new and while running, it will only transition once stop() or stopIfRunning() has been called (and is running).  This can be used to check the state of services which may be able to accept requests/input before they are running (and ideally would handle those requests once started).\n- Fixed issue #130 where worker threads in PriorityScheduler may not exit after a shutdown or shutdownNow call.\n- Fixed issue #126 via pull request #128.  This defect in the SingleThreadScheduler would cause it so that if the execution thread was being started while ANOTHER thread was also trying to execute a task, it would get a RejectedExecutionException even though the scheduler had not been shut down.\n- Fixed issue where allowing garbage collection of SingleThreadScheduler, PriorityScheduler, PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker, or Profiler....could cause constructed threads to be leaked (and not stopped or collected).  This was fixed first for SingleThreadScheduler which was trivial, but then later fixed for the others in issue #124 and pull request #129\n- Updated build system to use gradle 2.3\n"}

This can provide a more accurate sample rate when there is a lot of threads.\n- Between 5% and 15% performance improvement in the PriorityScheduler due to the pull request #121\n- Added \"TestablePriorityScheduler\"...this is just like \"TestableScheduler\" except it implements the \"PrioritySchedulerInterface\".  This is useful for unit testing code which needs to accept that interface.  With that said, this implementation just ignores the \"TaskPriroity\", since it makes no sense in a single threaded context.\n- Deprecated DynamicDelayQueue, DynamicDelayedUpdater, and ConsumerIterator.  These previously were used in the PriorityScheduler, with the performance improvement from #121, they are no longer used.  Because the value to others seems minimal I went ahead and deprecated them to be removed in 4.0.0.

This is the same issue as #39.  It was believed that I had correctly ported that fix to the PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker, but I found a one line defect where that was not the case.  There is more unit testing now around this specific case.\n- Fixed defect in ExceptionUtils.makeRuntime where the makeRuntime call was included in the stack trace, but the base element was not included. See pull request #119\n- Significant performance improvements with the NoThreadScheduler and the SingleThreadSubmitterExecutor!  This is from the two queue method that was developed in #117\n- Some small performance improvements to the PriorityScheduler\n- Deprecated FutureUtils.addCallback, instead you should just add the callback on the future directly.\n- You can now longer scheduleAtFixedRate with a period of zero.  But with that we did fix it where scheduleAtFixedRate can cut in line from other waiting tasks if it is behind schedule (previously it would be like a new exection with a minimum delay of zero, now that delay can be negative to cut in line).  This is why a period of zero is no longer accepted, because in schedulers like NoThreadScheduler that could forever keep no other tasks from running.\n- Added ability to clear the result from a SettableListenableFuture.  This was to help assist in some designs where large amounts of futures are being chained together (and thus the result was possibly consuming too much heap).\n- Added new class \"ChainedRunnableListenableFuture\", which allows you to add a Future/callable as a listener and ensure it will execute on the thread pool (even if the future your adding to as a listener has already completed).\n- Added new class \"ClearOnGetSettableListenableFuture\".  This takes advantage of the above behavior by clearing the result as soon as .get() is called to get it.  This is obviously only useful in cases where:\n\n1) you need to clear the result to allow garbage collection\n\n....and....\n\n2) the .get() function will only be called once (as subsequent calls will throw an exception).\n"}

This allows you to have a more predictible execution rate, regardless of how long the task actually takes to run.  If a task takes longer to execute than the recurring period, it will NOT execute concurrently.  Instead it will wait till execution finishes, then immediately try to get a thread again to execute again.\n- Some performance improvements to the KeyDistributedScheduler when \"scheduleAtFixedRate\" is called with an initial delay of zero.\n- Fixed issue in TestableScheduler where if you advance, or call tick with a faster than real time, and then call \".tick()\" it no longer will throw an Exception.  Instead it will tick with the last known time, which will execute anything which has been added to the scheduler with a .execute() since the last tick or advance.\n- Expanded Clock functionality to have new functions \"forwardProgressing\" to get a time in millis since epoc (similar to accurateTimeMillis and lastKnownTimeMillis).  The difference is that if the system clock changes, or is paused, the forwardProgressing time will continue to move forward, and never backwards.\n- Used the above Clock functionality to fix issue #109.  This is an issue where moving the clock backwards or forwards might cause a scheduled task to either not execute, or execute early.  The new changes do have some load implications on Windows (though are not ANY slower on linux or OSX).  Though this performance penalty is nothing more than java's built in thread pools.  In fact threadly is still substantially better performing since it has to do fewer time look ups (and instead uses cached values when possible and safe).\n"}

We plan to release 3.0.0 either on the same day, or shortly after 2.6.0 is released.  If any significant bugs are found, we will release a 2.6.1 patch release, but now new features will be added to the version 2.X line after this release.\n\nThis release does include some minor deprecations in the BlockingQueueConsumer, as well as StringUtils.EMPTY.  If you use either of those classes, make sure you are current with this before going to version 3.0.0.\n\nChanges/Improvements included in this release:\n- Changed license from LGPL 3 to Mozzila Public License 2.0 (MPL).  This should have less restrictions for others wanting to use our library.  Particularly less restrictions around static linking, or creating fat jars.  The goal of the project is for anyone who wishes (proprietary or not) to be able to use the license, we just want to ensure that changes and improvements get provided back to the community.  If there are restrictions in the MPL that are not conductive to you, please let us know and we will work to make it work for your needs.\n- Added new class \"AbstractService\" to help with building services (either with their own thread, or running on a thread pool).  This provides a small generic implementation for services which have a life cycle of being constructed, started, then stopped.  It is expected that after stopped, they are never restarted.\n- Improved performance in PriorityScheduler around low priority tasks.  Specifically avoiding the low priority delay when no threads have been created yet (and thus only a low priority task has been executed).  As well as simplifying the logic when the thread pool has reached the maximum possible thread count (thus also providing some modest speed improvements).\n- Other minor speed improvements in PriorityScheduler by simplifying how and when we need to check if worker threads are running (in part facilitated by using the new \"AbstractService\").\n- Dramatic javadoc improvements.  Correctly links to referenced functions/code within the javadocs for easier navigation, as well as a few corrections and clarifications.\n- Deprecated StringUtils.EMPTY, a colleague convinced me it is not worth maintaining, so it will be removed in 3.0.0\n- Deprecated the maybeStart in BlockingQueueConsumer.  Instead you should pass in the ThreadFactory at construction time, and then call either start() or startIfNotStarted() (depending on the behavior you want).\n"}

A couple small bug fixes, and a rename of the Task(Executor/Scheduler)Distributor.  Because of that rename, this release includes deprecation of some things, and will be removed in 3.0.0 release.\n\nChanges/Fixes included in this release:\n- Renamed TaskExecutorDistributor into KeyDistributedExecutor, and renamed TaskSchedulerDistributor into KeyDistributedScheduler.  The old versions are marked as deprecated in this release (so wont break compatability till 3.0.0).\n- Small fix for the rarely used implementations of PrioritySchedulerServiceWrapper and SingleThreadSchedulerService wrapper where invokeAll, after a timeout, may not have canceled all unfinished tasks.  If we were waiting on a task to finish, and we reached our timeout period, that task would not be canceled (but all other tasks would have been canceled).  So this is only an issue when calling invokeAll with a timeout specified (and not all tasks complete that timeout).\n- Small fix for the rarely used implementations of PrioritySchedulerServiceWrapper and SingleThreadSchedulerService wrapper where invokeAny would stop invokations after the first failure.  It now respects that if a failure occurs it continues to try further invokations, until all fail (at which point it throws the last ExecutionException it got).\n"}

Thus trying to provide the result from .get() as quick as possible (and freeing up threads from just needlessly blocking).\n- Added ExceptionHandlerInterface to allow threadly to avoid using java's UncaughtExceptionHandler.  Threadly does not allow threads to die from exceptions, and calls info the UncaughtExceptionHandler even when a thread may not die.  This new interface allows you to continue to preserver java's \"UncaughtExceptionHandler\" behavior, while providing a facility for threadly to notify of when errors occur.\n- Fixed bug where exception thrown from UncaughtExceptionHandler can cause a thread to die and be leaked from the PriorityScheduler thread pool\n- Small changes around how arguments are verifies.  Making the message in the exceptions more regular.\n"}

The old version will be removed in 3.0.0\n- Fixed constructor defect in TaskSchedulerDistributor where boolean to track the accurateQueueSize was not respected (in the constructor TaskSchedulerDistributor(int expectedParallism, SimpleSchedulerInterface scheduler,  boolean accurateQueueSize))\n- Fixed constructor defect in PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker where boolean for using daemon threads was not respected (in the constructor PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker(int corePoolSize, int maxPoolSize, long keepAliveTimeInMs, TaskPriority defaultPriority, long maxWaitForLowPriorityInMs, boolean useDaemonThreads))\n- Fixed issue in ExceptionUtils.handleException where it would not use the threads locally set UncaughtExceptionHandler, and instead would defer directly to the \"Thread.getDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler\"\n"}

The main feature improvements are around making it easier to build event driven listener/callback designs. Part of this release includes deprecation of some things that were renamed (and will be removed in 3.0.0 release).\n\nChanges included in this release:\n- Deprecated org.threadly.concurrent.ListenerHelper due to it moving to the new package location: org.threadly.concurrent.event.RunnableListenerHelper.\n- Fixed bug in RunnableListenerHelper where listeners could not be removed from a listener that is executing on the same thread as \"callListeners\"\n- Added class \"ListenerHelper\" as a compliment to RunnableListenerHelper.  RunnableListenerHelper is still focused and designed around notifying events where arguments are not necessary (and thus the Runnable interface can be used).  The new ListenerHelper provides a generic and robust implementation for callbacks which can accept ANY interface, with arguments and possibly multiple functions.  I know the names are somewhat confusing as the old ListenerHelper name has been changed to RunnableListenerHelper, and the \"ListenerHelper\" is now designed around ANY interface.  But I believe this confusion will be short term, as these names better describe what they are doing now.  If people have recommendations for any name changes, you can always file an issue in github.\n- Added a few other classes for handling listeners with different threading possibilities.  \"AsyncCallListenerHelper\" and \"AsyncCallRunnableListenerHelper\" will ensure that the call to call the listeners does not block.  These are ideal when there are a LARGE number of listeners, but the listeners are quick to execute.  We also added \"DefaultExecutorListenerHelper\" and \"DefaultExecutorRunnableListenerHelper\" add an executor if none was provided when the listener was added, but the submission of the listeners to the executor still occurs on the calling thread.  This has the added feature in that it ensures that any single listener will NOT execute concurrently, despite being submitted to a possibly multi-threaded executor.  This implementation is ideal for when the listeners are very complex/long running.\n- Renamed PriorityScheduledExecutor into the more concise and consistent name \"PriorityScheduler\" (the old version will be removed in 3.0.0)\n- Renamed PriorityScheduledExecutorServiceWrapper into the more concise and consistent name \"PrioritySchedulerServiceWrapper\" (the old version will be removed in 3.0.0)\n- More flexible constructor interface for BlockingQueueConsumer (which is backwards compatible obviously, and likely wont be relevant to most people).\n- Improved behavior with detecting concurrent modifications in DynamicDelayQueue's ConsumingIterator\n"}

It also includes a few new features and improvements around classes/implementations that already exist.\n\nChanges included in this release:\n- Added StringUtils class.  This is a simple class that was primarily to make things easier for threadly itself, but may be useful to others.\n- Profiler, DebugLogger, and ExceptionUtils now use a system specific line separator.  This is in thanks to StringUtils.\n- Added javadocs for many private/protected implementations (to make following the code and extending the library easier)..these are not included in our released javadocs since we only publish the public API.  But these can be easily found with a small tweak to gradle.\n- Added shutdownNow functionality to the SingleThreadScheduler (and improved shutdown behavior in SingleThreadScheduler).\n- Fixed bug in PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker.shutdownNow where returned runnables are actually the wrappers we use for stat tracking.  We now unwrap those runnables as the interface is expecting.\n- Fixed bug in PriorityScheduledExecutor.shutdownNow where the \"ShutdownRunnable\" may be included in the returned list of canceled runnables.  This runnable is used internally as part of the shutdown process, and so should not have been returned to the user.\n- Cleared up difference in behavior with scheduleWithFixedDelay when an exception would occur (in threadly we will continue to run the task, in the implementations of java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService it will stop recurring executions).  This is now consistent with the behavior that both interfaces expect across the board, as well as better documented in the javadocs.\n"}

This existed in some form pre 2.0.0, but with the addition of the SingleThreadScheduler in 2.0.0 we now rely on this functionality more, and I felt that it was important to patch.

Most things implement this interface now, giving great functionality when passing around the interfaces.\n- Added \"RateLimiterExecutor\".  This is a new form of limiter, unlike the others which attempt to limit concurrency (for the use of sub pools).  This one is designed to limit the rate of accessing a resource in a non-blocking way.  Please check out the javadocs, and feel free to file an issue if you have any questions.\n- Added in \"SingleThreadScheduler\" to provide a simpler, lighter weight version of a scheduler when only one thread is desired.\n"}

This allows you to avoid blocking if you prefer.\n- Added FutureCallback, as well as expanded ListenableFuture to allow \"FutureCallback\" to be added directly on a future.  Since it is often you want the listener to just be called so you know to get a result, the FutureCallback provides an easy way to get the result (or error) directly.\n- Added \"SameThreadSubmitterExecutor\".  A simple executor implementation that will just execute on the existing thread that is providing the task.\n- Performance improvements to the TaskExecutorDistributior and the TaskSchedulerDistributor\n- Added ability to get the task queue length for a given thread key in the TaskExecutorDistributior/TaskSchedulerDistributor (but you must construct with a true to enable accurate tracking, otherwise it is an extremely rough estimate).\n- Fixed issue in PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker where it was not handling the fix for issue #34 correctly\n- Renamed \"ListenableFutureResult\" to \"SettableListenableFuture\" (since I think this makes it more obvious what it does).  This is backwards compatible, as the old ListenableFutureResult still exists for now, but will be removed in 2.0.0.\n- Started marking things as deprecated that will be removed in 2.0.0...see issues set for the 2.0.0 milestone to understand what will be removed\n"}

This includes the changes to move to semantic version, as described here: https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Version-Guide\n\nBecause we are trying to get a lot more stable API for the 1.0.0 release we actually ended up changing more than expected.  We focused on simplifying things, and removed a bunch of things we don't think makes sense to support.  We wanted to go ahead and do this now, otherwise we would have to wait till a 2.0.0 release to do these changes.  If for any reason we were incorrect and others found any of the removed features/classes useful, **PLEASE** let us know via an issue so that we can add those features back.\n\nImprovements included in this release:\n- Fixed issue #54 where tasks could be blocked indefinitely after increasing the max pool size (under very specific conditions).\n- Fixed minor issue where adding or rescheduling a task _may_ be unfairly queued with very large amounts of waiting tasks.  This was an extremely rare race condition, and has not been seen or reported, but was theoretically possible.\n- Fixed issue in NoThreadScheduler where you may not be able to remove a recurring task concurrently if the task is currently running.\n- Fixed issue in NoThreadScheduler where you can not remove a task if it is submitted from a Limiter.\n- Fixed issue in NoThreadScheduler where you can not remove callables.\n- Unit test improvements (reliability and code coverage, over 91% coverage now!)\n- Lots of javadoc improvements.  Better descriptions, as well as fixes for minor details that were incorrect.\n- Improved accuracy for scheduled task execution when there is a very high quantity of tasks, with short scheduled delays.\n- Removed the ability to construct a non-thread safe NoThreadScheduler.  If your using the constructor which accepts a boolean, just remove this argument **This is a non-backwards compatible change**.  I did this because I decided to simplify the code and always have the NoThreadScheduler able to accept submission/removal calls from any thread.  So they are always thread safe now.  I figure that the extra overhead of synchronizing is probably minimal in the other case (since the lock should not be under contention).\n- Removed the \"CallableDistributor\".  This was created before Threadly had first class support for futures.  Now that it has full support for futures, you can just use a HashMap, or a blocking queue, or something similar to very easily (and more efficiently) produce the same behavior.  **This is a non backwards compatible change**.  I removed this because now that we have future support, it seemed unlikely anyone would want to use it.  But if anyone likes this feature for some reason please post an issue and let us know (always easy to bring back).\n- Removed the TestablePriorityScheduler and infrastructure.  This dramatically simplified and reduced the code.  Because this was very difficult to implement for (any time you do anything that blocks you must consider it), I decided it likely would be too hard for others to use in complicated software.  So I decided to remove it.  **This is a non-backwards compatible change**  The following were removed:\n  - **VirtualLock**\n  - **VirtualRunnable**\n  - **VirtualCallable**\n  - **TestablePriorityScheduler**\n- Dramatically simplified the limiter implementations, as well as provided performance improvements.  They no longer are dependent on the FutureFuture and FutureListernableFuture implementations which require a future to be provided later.  Instead they just construct a ListernableFutureTask and use that for the entire runnable lifecycle.  This reduced code and simplified a lot of things.  This also allowed us to combine two classes into one.  **This is a non-backwards compatible change** SimpleSchedulerLimiter and SubmitterSchedulerLimiter both combined into a single class \"SchedulerLimiter\".  This new class only requires a \"SimpleSchedulerInterface\" implementation at construction.  PrioritySchedulerLimiter's changes are fully backwards compatible.\n- Because FutureFuture and FutureListernableFuture are no longer needed within threadly, they were removed.  They are difficult to use correctly (particularly around canceling), and as we found in the Limiter's there was a much simpler implementation once we avoided those classes.  Because we no longer needed them, and because they are likely hard and have little value for everyone else we decided to remove them before the 1.0.0 release **This is a non-backwards compatible change**\n- Added call getCurrentRunningCount to the PriorityScheduledExecutor (so you don't have to use the statistic tracker for just this one simple value).\n- Renamed The PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker getCurrentlyRunningCount to getCurrentRunningCount **This is a non-backwards compatible change** but should be pretty minor since it only affects people using the statistic tracker, and is a simple two character removal.\n- Renamed PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker get[High/Low]PriorityThreadReusePercent to get[High/Low]PriorityThreadAvailablePercent.  The name was missleading to what statistic was really being provided here.  This is how frequently a thread was almost immediately available.  Meaning we did not have to wait for a running task to finish, nor did we have to create a thread.  **This is a non-backwards compatible change** but should be pretty minor since it only affects people using the statistic tracker.\n- Added a little utility \"AsyncVerifier\" in order to assist with verifications in unit tests for operations happening in multiple threads.\n- Improved the performance of the TaskExecutorDistributor as described in #56.\n"}

I decided that an inefficient implementation was better than none, so it is now implemented (but be aware that it would be much better to use scheduleWithFixedDelay if possible).\n- Added \"FutureUtils\" class, which right now only has one function basically (to block until a collection of futures all complete).\n- Split apart the interface SubmitterSchedulerInterface into a sub interface SubmitterExecutorInterface.  SubmitterSchedulerInterface extends the new interface, so this is a backwards compatible change.\n- New class called \"ExecutorWrapper\" which allows you to turn a simple Executor into an implementation of SubmitterExecutorInterface.\n- ExecutorLimiter now implements SubmitterExecutorInterface instead of just Executor now.  This also is a backwards compatible change.\n- Improvements and fixes to the PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker\n- Improvements to Profiler and unit tests for profiler (but no notable features new features or bug fixes)\n- The improvements to the profiler allowed a new class \"ControlledThreadProfiler\" which allows the user to control exactly which threads should be profiled.\n"}

down slightly as we focus on stability in prep of the 1.0.0 release.\n\nChanges/Features included in 0.8:\n- Fixed issue #43, which can cause high cpu usage if a running task thread is interrupted.\n- Added a small, and simple call to the PriorityScheduledExecutor so that you can get the qty of waiting, and scheduled tasks.\n- Added the ability to make sure that a specific key given to the TaskExecutorDistributor or TaskSchedulerDistributor will not starve other keys if the tasks are given to it faster than it can actually run them.  This comes with some performance hits (but only when using the new optional parameter, and this is of course a backwards compatible change).\n- Added a very simple \"Profiler\" to help in quick debugging of performance issues within your application.  It collects data over time, and returns you information on a per thread basis, as well as the entire VM.\n- Moved NoThreadScheduler from package org.threadly.test.concurrent to just org.threadly.concurrent.  This seems to make more sense because I found it has more use in general than just in unit testing.  **This is a non-backwards compatible change**\n- NoThreadScheduler now returns ListenableFuture's instead of just basic Future's\n- Submitted callables can now be removed from the PriorityScheduledExecutor thread pool\n- Tasks submitted through Limiters are now able to be removed from the PriorityScheduledExecutor (but not necessarily other thread pool implementations)\n- Up to almost 87% unit test coverage!  This is due to a low amount of code duplication, and really through and complete unit tests.  This number has only gone up between each release, and I plan to keep it very high going forward.\n"}

It is not designed to be used in the normal case (although it can be, it just incurs a performance impact), but can be a very valuable tool as a drop in replacement for debugging.\n- Added ExecutorLimiter and PrioritySchedulerLimiter so that one thread pool can be used by different areas of code can easily have different levels of concurrency. Thus allowing for greater thread control and better usage of thread pools across your application.\n"}

It includes a ton of new functionality. It also has a lot of performance improvements and bug fixes. Changes to take note of:\n- Removed SynchronizedDynamicDelayQueue implementation and interface...which has been replaced by a completely new implementation just called \"DynamicDelayQueue\". This implementation is better performing, implements the BlockingQueue interface...I saw no reason to keep the old method, we likely will never need more than one implementation of this type of structure.\n- Created a new collection called \"ConcurrentArrayList\". This is a thread safe array list that is used for the new DynamicDelayQueue. It differers from CopyOnWriteArrayList in that it synchronizes in order to give very strong consistency guarantees. Because of this it is actually able to avoid copies on some operations (and can be better performing). It is particularly better performing when using the reposition operation needed by the DynamicDelayQueue.\n- Separated out DynamicDelayQueue and ConcurrentArrayList into a new package org.threadly.concurrent.collections\n- Created new abstraction CallableDistributor that makes it easier to submit callables and collect those results. It provides similar functionality as the Futures that are returned from java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService but provide several advantages. First the thread collection the results are easier to make different from the submitter threads (you don't have to pass the futures). The second large advantage is it controls what callables are run in parallel by ensuring that the same keys are never run concurrently, this advantage comes from using the TaskExecutorDistributor.\n- Created a StripedLock for the VirtualLocks. This may be useful for anyone who wants to reduce lock contention with our testable VirtualLocks. We are using it to reduce lock contention for the TaskExecutorDistributor and the new CallableDistributor.\n- Improved general performance and throughput of the PriorityScheduledExecutor, primarily due to changes with the new DynamicDelayQueue. The largest improvement is in recurring task performance, which has a 10% execution throughput improvement.\n- Added in Future support for submitting runnables and callables into PriorityScheduledExecutor (or any SimpleSchedulerInterface implementer). The old calls without future returns still exist because there is a performance impact when using the futures. So this should only be used when it makes sense to do so.\n- Increased functionality for TestRunnable class...allowing for asynchronous actions that can be done after runnable starts, but before it finishes.\n- Many bugs fixed, and much better unit test coverage compared to 0.2 (82%!)\n"}
