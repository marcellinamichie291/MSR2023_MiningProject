It contains lots of improvements and bug fixes.\r\nThe main changes are:\r\n- More Kotlin extensions in the `ble-ktx` module. \r\n\r\n   Now, apart from `suspend()` method, which returns `Data` for `ReadRequest` and `WriteReqeust` (client side) and `WaitForValueChangedRequest` and `WaitForReadRequest` (server side), you may use `suspendForResponse()` and `suspendForValidResponse()` which return an object extending `ReadResponse` or `WriteResponse`.\r\n   The notifications and indications can also be collected as response Flow using new `asResponseFlow()` and `asValidResponseFlow()`.\r\n   With #371 merged it is also possible to get progress indications as flow for outgoing packets using a splitter and incoming packets using a merger. Use `splitWithProgressFlow(Splitter)` or `mergeWithProgressFlow(Merger)`.\r\n\r\n- #352 added support for Big Endian encoding in the `Data` class to make writing and reading values easier. #353 has deprecated `FORMAT_xxx` constants in favor of `FORMAT_xxx_LE` or `FORMAT_xxx_BE`.\r\n\r\n- #370 allowed to filter fully merged packets. Previously, the `filter(...)` option allowed to filter incoming packets before they were given to the merger. The new `filterPacket(...)` does similar thing, but with complete, merged, received packet.\r\n\r\n- And, as usual, reported bugs were fixed.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed since beta 3\r\n* Filtering merged packets by @philips77 in https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-BLE-Library/pull/370\r\n* Typo in license fixed by @philips77 in https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-BLE-Library/pull/372\r\n* Progress indication as flow by @philips77 in https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-BLE-Library/pull/371\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-BLE-Library/compare/2.4.0-beta03...2.4.0", "mentions_count": 1}
