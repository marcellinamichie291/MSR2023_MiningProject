The `tpr_resid_from_one` keyword has been added to modify this behaviour (Issue #2364)\r\n\r\nEnhancements:\r\n - The `get_connections` method has been added to more easily get bonds, angles, dihedrals, etc.. for a group (Issues #1264 #2821)\r\n\r\nSee the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/blob/release-1.1.1/package/CHANGELOG) for more changes and details.\r\n\r\n### Known issues:\r\n - Windows builds\r\n    * For some compilers (seen on MVC v.19xx), differences in floating point precision leads to PBC wrapping differing from expected outcomes. This leads to failures in the `MDAnalysisTests.lib.test_augment` tests. To our knowledge this does not significantly affect results (as all other tests pass). We will aim to fix this in version 2.0.\r\n    * For python 3.5 only, extra tests failures are seen. These mostly relate to deprecations and warnings being raised upstream (primarily by `os.path`). As far as we know they do not affect the validity of the code. The following tests are affected:\r\n        * `MDAnalysisTests.analysis.test_base::test_analysis_class_decorator`\r\n        * `MDAnalysisTests.analysis.test_dihedrals::TestRamachandran::test_protein_ends`\r\n        * `MDAnalysisTests.analysis.test_helanal::test_warnings`\r\n        * `MDAnalysisTests.coordinates.test_chainreader::TestChainReaderContinuous::test_easy_trigger_warning`\r\n        * `MDAnalysisTests.utils.test_streamio::TestNamedStream_filename_behaviour::test_func[abspath]`\r\n\r\n### Notes:\r\n\r\n* Release 1.1.1 fixes an installation issue with 1.1.0. There is no published release for version 1.1.0.\r\n* As detailed in the 1.0.0 release, the 1.x releases only include bug fix changes. New features are being developed for MDAnalysis 2.x."}
