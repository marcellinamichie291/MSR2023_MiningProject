`LanguageDetectorBuilder.with_low_accuracy_mode()` has been introduced. By activating it, detection accuracy for short text is reduced in favor of a smaller memory footprint and faster detection performance.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n- The memory footprint has been reduced significantly by storing the language models in structured NumPy arrays instead of dictionaries. This reduces memory consumption from 2600 MB to 800 MB, approximately.\r\n- Several language model files have become obsolete and could be deleted without decreasing detection accuracy. This results in a smaller memory footprint.\r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\n\r\n- The lowest supported Python version is 3.8 now. Python 3.7 is no longer compatible with this library."}

Previously, it could be installed from PyPI only with Python >= 3.9.
