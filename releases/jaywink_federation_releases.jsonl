([related issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/82))\r\n\r\n  JSON encrypted payload encryption and decryption is handled by the Diaspora `EncryptedPayload` class.\r\n  \r\n* Add RFC3033 webfinger generator ([related issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/108))\r\n\r\n  Also provided is a Django view and url configuration for easy addition into Django projects. Django is not a hard dependency of this library, usage of the Django view obviously requires installing Django itself. For configuration details see documentation.\r\n\r\n* Add fetchers and parsers for NodeInfo, NodeInfo2, StatisticsJSON and Mastodon server metainfo documents.\r\n\r\n* Add NodeInfo2 generator and Django view. See documentation for details. ([related issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/32))\r\n\r\n* Added new network utilities to fetch IP and country information from a host.\r\n\r\n  The country information is fetched using the free `ipdata.co` service. NOTE! This service is rate limited to 1500 requests per day.\r\n  \r\n* Extract mentions from Diaspora payloads that have text content. The mentions will be available in the entity as `_mentions` which is a set of Diaspora ID's in URI format.\r\n  \r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n* Send outbound Diaspora payloads in new format. Remove possibility to generate legacy MagicEnvelope payloads. ([related issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/82))\r\n\r\n* **Backwards incompatible**.  Refactor `handle_send` function\r\n    \r\n  Now handle_send high level outbound helper function also allows delivering private payloads using the Diaspora protocol. ([related issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/82))\r\n  \r\n  The signature has changed. Parameter `recipients` should now be a list of recipients to delivery to. Each recipient should either be an `id` or a tuple of `(id, public key)`. If public key is provided, Diaspora protocol delivery will be made as an encrypted private delivery.\r\n  \r\n* **Backwards incompatible**. Change `handle_create_payload` function signature.\r\n\r\n  Parameter `to_user` is now `to_user_key` and thus instead of an object containing the `key` attribute it should now be an RSA public key object instance. This simplifies things since we only need the key from the user, nothing else.\r\n\r\n* Switch Diaspora protocol to send new style entities ([related issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/59))\r\n\r\n  We've already accepted these on incoming payloads for a long time and so do all the other platforms now, so now we always send out entities with the new property names. This can break federation with really old servers that don't understand these keys yet. \r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n* Change unquote method used when preparing Diaspora XML payloads for verification ([related issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/115))\r\n\r\n  Some platforms deliver payloads not using the urlsafe base64 standard which caused problems when validating the unquoted signature. Ensure maximum compatibility by allowing non-standard urlsafe quoted payloads.\r\n  \r\n* Fix for empty values in Diaspora protocol entities sometimes ending up as `None` instead of empty string when processing incoming payloads.\r\n\r\n* Fix validation of `Retraction` with entity type `Share`\r\n\r\n* Allow port in Diaspora handles as per the protocol specification\r\n\r\n  Previously handles were validated like emails.\r\n  \r\n* Fix Diaspora `Profile` mapping regarding `last_name` property\r\n\r\n  Previously only `first_name` was used when creating the `Profile.name` value. Now both `first_name` and `last_name` are used.\r\n  \r\n  When creating outgoing payloads, the `Profile.name` will still be placed in `first_name` to avoid trying to artificially split it.\r\n    "}

([related issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/94))\r\n\r\n  The `Share` entity supports all the properties that a Diaspora reshare does. Additionally two other properties are supported: `raw_content` and `entity_type`. The former can be used for a \"quoted share\" case where the sharer adds their own note to the share. The latter can be used to reference the type of object that was shared, to help the receiver, if it is not sharing a `Post` entity. The value must be a base entity class name.\r\n \r\n* Entities have two new properties: `id` and `target_id`.\r\n\r\n  Diaspora entity ID's are in the form of the [Diaspora URI scheme](https://diaspora.github.io/diaspora_federation/federation/diaspora_scheme.html), where it is possible to construct an ID from the entity. In the future, ActivityPub object ID's will be found in these properties. \r\n\r\n* New high level fetcher function `federation.fetchers.retrieve_remote_content`. ([related issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/103))\r\n\r\n  This function takes the following parameters:\r\n  \r\n    * `id` - Object ID. For Diaspora, the only supported protocol at the moment, this is in the [Diaspora URI](https://diaspora.github.io/diaspora_federation/federation/diaspora_scheme.html) format.\r\n    * `sender_key_fetcher` - Optional function that takes a profile `handle` and returns a public key in `str` format. If this is not given, the public key will be fetched from the remote profile over the network.\r\n    \r\n  The given ID will be fetched from the remote endpoint, validated to be from the correct author against their public key and then an instance of the entity class will be constructed and returned.\r\n\r\n* New Diaspora protocol helpers in `federation.utils.diaspora`:\r\n\r\n  * `retrieve_and_parse_content`. See notes regarding the high level fetcher above.\r\n  * `fetch_public_key`. Given a `handle` as a parameter, will fetch the remote profile and return the `public_key` from it.\r\n  * `parse_diaspora_uri`. Parses a Diaspora URI scheme string, returns either `None` if parsing fails or a `tuple` of `handle`, `entity_type` and `guid`.\r\n  \r\n* Support fetching new style Diaspora protocol Webfinger (RFC 3033) ([related issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/108))\r\n\r\n  The legaxy Webfinger is still used as fallback if the new Webfinger is not found. \r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n* Refactoring for Diaspora `MagicEnvelope` class.\r\n\r\n  The class init now also allows passing in parameters to construct and verify MagicEnvelope instances. The order of init parameters has not been changed, but they are now all optional. When creating a class instance, one should always pass in the necessary parameters depnding on whether the class instance will be used for building a payload or verifying an incoming payload. See class docstring for details.\r\n  \r\n* Diaspora procotol receive flow now uses the `MagicEnvelope` class to verify payloads. No functional changes regarding verification otherwise.\r\n\r\n* Diaspora protocol receive flow now fetches the sender public key over the network if a `sender_key_fetcher` function is not passed in. Previously an error would be raised.\r\n\r\n  Note that fetching over the network for each payload is wasteful. Implementers should instead cache public keys when possible and pass in a function to retrieve them, as before.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n* Converting base entity `Profile` to `DiasporaProfile` for outbound sending missed two attributes, `image_urls` and `tag_list`. Those are now included so that the values transfer into the built payload.\r\n\r\n* Fix fallback to HTTP in the `fetch_document` network helper in the case of `ConnectionError` when trying HTTPS. Thanks @autogestion.\r\n\r\n* Ensure `handle` is always lower cased when fetching remote profile using `retrieve_remote_profile`. Warning will be logged if an upper case handle is passed in.\r\n"}

Even though we already verified the signature of the sender, we didn't ensure that the sender isn't trying to fake an entity authored by someone else. \r\n\r\n  The Diaspora protocol functions `message_to_objects` and `element_to_objects` now require a new parameter, the payload sender handle. These functions should normally not be needed to be used directly. \r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n* **Breaking change.** The high level `federation.outbound` functions `handle_send` and `handle_create_payload` signatures have been changed. This has been done to better represent the objects that are actually sent in and to add an optional `parent_user` object.\r\n\r\n  For both functions the `from_user` parameter has been renamed to `author_user`. Optionally a `parent_user` object can also be passed in. Both the user objects must have `private_key` and `handle` attributes.

This was an `etree.Element` created from the source object. Due to serialization issues in applications (for example pushing the object to a task queue or saving to database), `_source_object` is now a byte string representation for the element done with `etree.tostring()`. \r\n\r\n### Added\r\n* New style Diaspora private encrypted JSON payloads are now supported in the receiving side. Outbound private Diaspora payloads are still sent as legacy encrypted payloads. ([issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/83))\r\n    * No additional changes need to be made when calling `handle_receive` from your task processing. Just pass in the full received XML or JSON payload as a string with recipient user object as before.\r\n* Add `created_at` to Diaspora `Comment` entity XML creator. This is required in renewed Diaspora protocol. ([related issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/59))\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n* Fix getting sender from a combination of legacy Diaspora encrypted payload and new entity names (for example `author`). This combination probably only existed in this library.\r\n* Correctly extend entity `_children`. Certain Diaspora payloads caused `_children` for an entity to be written over by an empty list, causing for example status message photos to not be saved. Correctly do an extend on it. ([issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/89))\r\n* Fix parsing Diaspora profile `tag_string` into `Profile.tag_list` if the `tag_string` is an empty string. This caused the whole `Profile` object creation to fail. ([issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/88))\r\n* Fix processing Diaspora payload if it is passed to `handle_receive` as a `bytes` object. ([issue](https://github.com/jaywink/federation/issues/91))\r\n* Fix broken Diaspora relayables after latest 0.2.0 protocol changes. Previously relayables worked only because they were reverse engineered from the legacy protocol. Now that XML order is not important and tag names can be different depending on which protocol version, the relayable forwarding broke. To fix, we don't regenerate the entity when forwarding it but store the original received object when generating a `parent_author_signature` (which is optional in some cases, but we generate it anyway for now). This happens in the previously existing `entity.sign_with_parent()` method. In the sending part, if the original received object (now with a parent author signature) exists in the entity, we send that to the remote instead of serializing the entity to XML.\r\n     * To forward a relayable you must call `entity.sign_with_parent()` before calling `handle_send` to send the entity.\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n* `Post.photos` entity attribute was never used by any code and has been removed. Child entities of type `Image` are stored in the `Post._children` as before.\r\n* Removed deprecated user private key lookup using `user.key` in Diaspora receive processing. Passed in `user` objects must now have a `private_key` attribute. "}

The simple `Follow` maps to Diaspora contact entity with following/sharing both true or false. Sharing as a separate concept is not currently supported.\r\n* Added `_receiving_guid` to all entities. This is filled with `user.guid` if `user` is passed to `federation.inbound.handle_receive` and it has a `guid`. Normally in for example Diaspora, this will always be done in private payloads.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n* Legacy Diaspora retraction of sharing/following is now supported correctly. The end result is a `DiasporaRetraction` for entity type `Profile`. Since the payload doesn't contain the receiving user for a sharing/following retraction in legacy Diaspora protocol, we store the guid of the user in the entity as `_receiving_guid`, assuming it was passed in for processing."}

On inbound payloads the signature included in the payload will be verified against the sender public key. A failed verification will raise `SignatureVerificationError`. For outbound entities, the author private key will be used to add a signature to the payload.\r\n\r\nThis introduces some backwards incompatible changes to the way entities are processed. Diaspora entity mappers `get_outbound_entity` and entity utilities `get_full_xml_representation` now requires the author `private_key` as a parameter. This is required to sign outgoing `Comment` and `Reaction` (like) entities. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Diaspora entity mappers `message_to_objects` and `element_to_objects` now take an optional `sender_key_fetcher` parameter. This must be a function that when called with the sender handle will return the sender public key. This allows using locally cached public keys instead of fetching them as needed. NOTE! If the function is not given, each processed payload will fetch the public key over the network. \r\n\r\nA failed payload signature verification now raises a `SignatureVerificationError` instead of a less specific `AssertionError`.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n* Three new attributes added to entities.\r\n    * Add protocol name to all entities to attribute `_source_protocol`. This might be useful for applications to know which protocol payload the entity was created from once multiple protocols are implemented.\r\n    * Add source payload object to the entity at `_source_object` when processing it.\r\n    * Add sender public key to the entity at `_sender_key`, but only if it was used for validating signatures.\r\n* Add support for the new Diaspora payload properties coming in the next protocol version. Old XML payloads are and will be still supported.\r\n* `DiasporaComment` and `DiasporaLike` will get the order of elements in the XML payload as a list in `xml_tags`. For implementers who want to recreate payloads for these relayables, this list should be saved for later use.\r\n* High level `federation.outbound.handle_send` helper function now allows sending entities to a list of recipients without having to deal with payload creation or caring about the protocol (in preparation of being a multi-protocol library).\r\n    * The function takes three parameters, `entity` that will be sent, `from_user` that is sending (note, not necessarely authoring, this user will be used to sign the payload for Diaspora for example) and a list of recipients as tuples of recipient handle/domain and optionally protocol. In the future, if protocol is not given, it will be guessed from the recipient handle, and if necessary a network lookup will be made to see what protocols the receiving identity supports.\r\n    * Payloads will be delivered to each receiver only once. Currently only public messages are supported through this helper, so multiple recipients on a single domain will cause only one delivery.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n* Refactor processing of Diaspora payload XML into entities. Diaspora protocol is dropping the `<XML><post></post></XML>` wrapper for the payloads. Payloads with the wrapper will still be parsed as before."}

It makes sense to unify these and also shorter names are generally nicer.\n\n#### What do you need to do?\n\nMostly nothing since the module was already called `federation`. Some things to note below:\n- Update your requirements with the new library name `federation`.\n- If you hook to the old logger `social-federation`, update those to listen to `federation`, which is now the standard logger name used throughout.\n\n### Other backwards incompatible changes\n- `federation.utils.diaspora.retrieve_and_parse_profile` will now return `None` if the `Profile` retrieved doesn't validate. This will affect also the output of `federation.fetchers.retrieve_remote_profile` which is the high level function to retrieve profiles.\n- Remove unnecessary `protocol` parameter from `federation.fetchers.retrieve_remote_profile`.

Library users should always be able to get a full validated object as we consider `guid` a core attribute of a profile.\n- Always validate entities created through `federation.entities.diaspora.mappers.message_to_objects`. This is the code that transforms federation messages for the Diaspora protocol to actual entity objects. Previously no validation was done and callers of `federation.inbound.handle_receive` received entities that were not always valid, for example they were missing a `guid`. Now validation is done in the conversion stage and errors are pushed to the `social-federation` logger in the event of invalid messages.\n  - Note Diaspora Profile XML messages do not provide a GUID. This is handled internally by fetching the guid from the remote hCard so that a valid `Profile` entity can be created.\n\n### Added\n- Raise a warning if unknown parameters are passed to entities.\n- Ensure entity required attributes are validated for `None` or empty string values. Required attributes must not only exist but also have a value.\n- Add validation to entities with the attribute `public`. Only `bool` values are accepted.\n\n### Changed\n- Function `federation.utils.diaspora.parse_profile_from_hcard` now requires a second argument, `handle`. Since in the future Diaspora hCard is not guaranteed to have username and domain, we now pass handle to the parser directly.\n"}

The magic envelope can be created using the class `federation.protocols.diaspora.magic_envelope.MagicEnvelope`. By default this will not wrap the payload message in `<XML><post></post></XML>`. To provide that functionality the class should be initialized with `wrap_payload=True`. No changes are made to the protocol send methods yet, if you need this new magic envelope you can initialize and render it directly.\n\n### Changed\n- Deprecate receiving user `key` attribute for Diaspora protocol. Instead correct attribute is now `private_key` for any user passed to `federation.inbound.handle_receive`. We already use `private_key` in the message creation code so this is just to unify the user related required attributes.\n  - DEPRECATION: There is a fallback with `key` for user objects in the receiving payload part of the Diaspora protocol until 0.8.0.\n\n### Fixes\n- Loosen up hCard selectors when parsing profile from hCard document in `federation.utils.diaspora.parse_profile_from_hcard`. The selectors now match Diaspora upcoming federation documentation.\n"}

The following methods have new import locations:\n  - `federation.controllers.handle_receive` -> `federation.inbound.handle_receive`\n  - `federation.controllers.handle_create_payload` -> `federation.outbound.handle_create_payload`\n- Class `federation.hostmeta.generators.DiasporaHCard` now requires `guid`, `public_key` and `username` for initialization. Leaving these out was a mistake in the initial implementation. Diaspora has these in at least 0.6 development branch.\n\n## Added\n- `Relationship` base entity which represents relationships between two handles. Types can be following, sharing, ignoring and blocking. The Diaspora counterpart, `DiasporaRequest`, which represents a sharing/following request is outwards a single entity, but incoming a double entity, handled by creating both a sharing and following version of  the relationship.\n- `Profile` base entity and Diaspora counterpart `DiasporaProfile`. Represents a user profile.\n- `federation.utils.network.fetch_document` utility function to fetch a remote document. Returns document, status code and possible exception. Takes either `url` or a `host` + `path` combination. With `host`, https is first tried and optionally fall back to http.\n- Utility methods to retrieve Diaspora user discovery related documents. These include the host-meta, webfinger and hCard documents. The utility methods are in `federation.utils.diaspora`.\n- Utility to fetch remote profile, `federation.fetchers.retrieve_remote_profile`. Currently always uses Diaspora protocol. Returns a `Profile` entity.\n\n## Changed\n- Unlock most of the direct dependencies to a certain version range. Unlock all of test requirements to any version.\n- Entities passed to `federation.controllers.handle_create_payload` are now converted from the base entity types (Post, Comment, Reaction, etc) to Diaspora entity types (DiasporaPost, DiasporaComment, DiasporaLike, etc). This ensures actual payload generation has the correct methods available (for example `to_xml`) whatever entity is passed in.\n\n### Fixes\n- Fix fetching sender handle from Diaspora protocol private messages. As it is not contained in the header, it needs to be read from the message content itself.\n- Fix various issues with `DiasporaHCard` template after comparing to some real world hCard templates from real pods. Old version was based on documentation in Diaspora project wiki.\n"}

See \"Changed\" below.\n\n### Added\n- Support for using `validate_field()` methods for entity fields and checking missing fields against `_required`. To use this validation, `validate()` must specifically be called for the entity instance.\n- Base entities `Comment` and `Reaction` which subclass the new `ParticipationMixin`.\n- Diaspora entity `DiasporaComment`, a variant of `Comment`.\n- Diaspora entity `DiasporaLike`, a variant of `Reaction` with the `reaction = \"like\"` default.\n\n### Changed\n- Refactored Diaspora XML generators into the Diaspora entities themselves. This introduces Diaspora versions of the base entities called `DiasporaPost`, `DiasporaComment` and `DiasporaLike`. **Any implementations using the Diaspora protocol and `Post` entities must now use `DiasporaPost` instead.**\n\n### Fixes\n- Entities which don't specifically get passed a `created_at` now get correct current time in `created_at` instead of always having the time part as `00:00`.\n"}
