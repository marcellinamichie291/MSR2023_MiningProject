This subcommand streams stdio from/to the target. It works with all debug probe types, not only J-Link. (Thanks @mikisama, @ccattuto)\r\n- There is no longer a need to install libusb separately when installing pyocd. The [libusb-package](https://github.com/pyocd/libusb-package) Python package was created so that an up to date libusb library can be automatically installed along with pyocd on all OSes.\r\n- Log output is now colorized by default when outputting to a tty. The `--color` command line argument controls this feature. Also simplified the log output formatting so it is easier to read.\r\n- Commander: Add `-x`/`--execute` argument to run commands from a file. Multiple command files can be run and mixed with `-c` commands.\r\n- Commander: Add `-i`/`--interactive` to stay in REPL after running commands from either a file or command line.\r\n- Commander: Introduce the `@command` decorator that can be used in user scripts to create user-defined commands, accessible from Commander and as gdbserver monitor commands. See [the documentation](https://pyocd.io/docs/user_scripts.html#user-defined-commands) for details.\r\n\r\n## Boards and targets\r\n\r\n- Add Maxim MAX32660 target and MAX32660EVSYS board. (Thanks @ozersa)\r\n- Correct RAM size of Maxim MAX32630 to 512 KiB.\r\n- Add several NXP board IDs: FRDM-K32L3A6, TWR-KM35Z75M, MIMXRT1160-EVK, FRDM-KW38, USB-KW38, KW38-ER-RD.\r\n- Add micro:bit v2 board IDs. (Thanks @mbrossard)\r\n- NXP LPC55xx family: re-unlock debug access after reset. (Thanks @LeBlue)\r\n\r\n## Changes and fixes\r\n\r\n- Cortex-M: Fix regression with writing CFBP and xPSR subregisters (CONTROL, FAULTMASK, BASEPRI, PRIMASK, and xPSR variants).\r\n- Gdbserver: While the target is running (`continue` command in gdb), retry reading target status within a timeout after the first fault on such a check. This is intended to primarily help with firmware putting the core to sleep. The `debug.status_fault_retry_timeout` session option controls the timeout; set it to 0 to disable this experimental feature.\r\n- Commander: Fix broken Python (\"$\") and system (\"!\") commands in certain cases.\r\n- Commander: The shell-like lexer for commands has been replaced with a custom lexer that is simpler and more predictable. It breaks words on all non-alphanumeric characters except dash (for instance, \"mem-ap\" is considered one word). Single and double quoted values with backslash-escapes are supported.\r\n- Commander: If a user script has been loaded, Python '$' commands share the user script's namespace.\r\n- Commands: Add `flushprobe` command that ensures all outstanding transfers on the probe have been completed.\r\n- Commands: Fix `reg` output so it is properly redirected when called as a gdbserver monitor command.\r\n- Commands: `reg` and `wreg' improvements. `-p` option to force lookup as peripheral register. `reg` will print any number of registers. Add `rr` and `wr` aliases.\r\n- User scripts: `print()` calls from user scripts get routed through any output direction, for example, such that the output will appear in the gdb console when a user-defined command is called as a gdbserver monitor command.\r\n- Flash: Change default value of `keep_unwritten` session option to false.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: Better handling of protocol versions.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: All USB backends have a USB packet trace logger.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: Add `cmsis_dap.prefer_v1` session option that forces pyocd to use the CMSIS-DAP v1 interface on a debug probe that provides both v1 and v2. (Naturally, the default is to choose v2, since it is faster.) This is intended primarily for testing.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: Introduced timeouts for USB reads.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: Limit number of outstanding command packets to 30 on macOS using hidapi for CMSIS-DAP v1. This fixes a failure that occurred when certain memory transfers due to an in-built limit on the queue size in the macOS version of hidapi.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: Update list of known CMSIS-DAP probes; correspondingly update udev rules.\r\n- STLink: use `JTAG_GET_BOARD_IDENTIFIERS` command to read board ID faster than extracting it from the \"mbed.htm\" file on the MSD volume. Requires V2J36 or V3J6 firmware versions.\r\n- STLink: Setting the SWD frequency on an STLinkV3 was completely broken, and is now fixed.\r\n- STLink: Add `stlink.v3_prescaler` session option to control the internal HCLK prescaler on the probe, which affects the set of available SWD/JTAG and other I/O frequencies.\r\n- Probe server: Fix race causing server to terminate immediately is certain rare cases.\r\n- Probe server: Improve connect/disconnect log messages.\r\n- Session options: Probe-specific options in a config file takes precedence over global options.\r\n- Session options: A warning is logged if a multiple probe-specific option sections in a config file match the active debug probe's UID.\r\n- Session: Change the working directory to the project directory on session creation.\r\n- Gdbserver: Cleanup and fix connection disconnect code. This changes behaviour if the gdb `disconnect` command is used so that the `persist` option is honoured (`disconnect` previously would never cause the gdbserver to stop). (Thanks @claymation)\r\n- Gdbserver: `exit` monitor command that will shut down all gdbservers and quit pyocd.\r\n- Gdbserver: Handle connection aborted and reset errors more cleanly.\r\n- Gdbserver: Better logging of RTOS discovery issues, and only one log message is output when attempting to load RTOS plugins, in addition to a message on successful load.\r\n- CoreSight DAP: Unlock probe on error. (Thanks @claymation)\r\n- CoreSight: Don't read CoreSight registers for non-CoreSight components. (Thanks @j4cbo)\r\n- CoreSight: Set `CSW.DBGSWEN` for CSSoC-400 APB-AP to resolve an issue that caused `DBGMCU` (and other) peripherals to be inaccessible on certain STM32 devices, and likely similar issues on other devices.\r\n- Dependencies: Switch from naturalsort to natsort. (Thanks @dvzrv)\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n- Introduced type annotations to a number of the most important parts of the pyocd source code.\r\n- Add `CoreTarget` class, a superclass of `Target` instances for CPU cores.\r\n- Ensure `set_clock()` works with float parameters for all probe drivers.\r\n- J-Link: Fix `is_reset_asserted()` method.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- A new CI board farm is up and running the functional test suite with Azure Pipelines on macOS, Linux, and Windows. All test results are [publicly accessible](https://dev.azure.com/pyocd/pyocd/_build?definitionId=1&_a=summary).\r\n- Improved command tests.\r\n- Fixed a number of small functional test failures in CI.\r\n- `automated_test.py` supports remote probes in its `-b` argument.\r\n- Fix issues in the semihosting unit test and restore telnet tests.\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n\r\n- `scripts/generate_flash_algo.py`: Removed the useless part of the standard flash algo blob header, leaving only the required breakpoint.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all the contributors who helped make this release possible! \u2764\ufe0f\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pyocd/pyOCD/compare/v0.32.3...v0.33.0", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pyocd/pyOCD/releases/57789066/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "mentions_count": 8}

Binary files can have a `@<address>` suffix added to the file name to supply the  base address at which they should be programmed.\r\n- Flash operations now have individual timeouts controllable with session options.\r\n- Reset: If performing a reset of any type causes the connection to the target's debug interface to be lost, pyocd will automatically reconnect.\r\n- Reset subcommand: `--core` and `--halt` arguments.\r\n- Cortex-M: when using the default `cortex_m` target type, the Cortex-M architectural memory map is supplied instead of having an empty memory map.\r\n- Config: Dashes are converted to underscores in the target type name, thus `cortex-m` is now equivalent to `cortex_m`.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: support for reading the debug probe firmware version with CMSIS-DAP v2.1. The firmware version is output at the debug log level.\r\n- STLink-V3: add new USB product IDs.\r\n- CoreSight: the product name is logged when listing CoreSight components during discovery.\r\n- gdbserver: add 'init' monitor command, which is ignored and exists solely for OpenOCD compatibility to prevent a warning.\r\n- Config: The effective target type is saved back into into session options. This mostly affects on-board debug probes that know their target.\r\n- Packaging: transitioned to PEP517 style packaging.\r\n- Flash: programming progress bar widened.\r\n\r\n## Targets\r\n\r\n- STM32L475: fix address of `DBGMCU.APB1FZR2` and `DBGMCU.APB2FZR` registers.\r\n- Musca-B1, Musca-S1: enable SYSRESETREQ from both cores.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Resolve an issue where running pyocd in the background from the shell, i.e. by the `&` operator, would cause a hang.\r\n- CMSIS Packs: use RAM addresses specified in algorithm elements. This fixes a programming on a few devices, including the Nordic nRF5340.\r\n- Commander: fix printing of D core register values.\r\n- Commander: fix Python expression output formatting for int and str values.\r\n- CMSIS Packs: make flash region names unique when splitting by sector size.\r\n- `load` subcommand: tildes in file name paths are resolved.\r\n- Subcommands: fix and improve command line argument usage text.\r\n- Memory map: names of memory regions are made unique if necessary.\r\n- Cortex-M: add a few checks to hopefully prevent an exception seen once when listing IRQ names.\r\n- Flash: correct arguments passed to flash exceptions.\r\n- CoreSight: only identify unknown APs as MEM-APs if the designer is Arm. This prevents some proprietary APs as being incorrectly reported as a MEM-AP.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: send only concrete SWD/JTAG port for connect, so that the \"default\" port type is never requested. This fixes connect for some versions of Microchip EDBG.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- Correct remote probe access documentation regarding remote access to the server  and the `--allow-remote` argument.\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n- `MemoryMap` now adheres to the Sequence ABC.\r\n- `MemoryRegion.clone_with_changes()` added.\r\n- `DebugPort.disconnect()` added.\r\n- `FlashLoader` class renamed to `MemoryLoader` to reflect RAM loading support. The old name is still available as an alias, but is deprecated.\r\n- `Timeout` class adds `start()` and `clear()` methods.\r\n\r\nThanks to all contributors, supporters, and users! \u2764\ufe0f "}

The original options will still work but are deprecated.\r\n- Added a `-L`/`--log-level` argument to easily control the log level of individual module loggers without needing a full logging config. Example: `-L*.cmsis_dap_probe=debug`.\r\n- Support for `PYOCD_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable. (#1172 @g-arjones)\r\n\r\n## Boards and targets\r\n\r\n- Fixed the target type for many STMicro board IDs to match the part numbers in the CMSIS DFPs. (#1127 @jeromecoutant)\r\n- Added several STMicro board IDs: NUCLEO-G071RB, NUCLEO-L010RB, NUCLEO-WB15CC, DISCO-WB5MMG, NUCLEO-U575ZI-Q, B-U585I-IOT02A. (#1166 @jeromecoutant)\r\n- Add Nuvoton NuMaker-M2354 board ID and M2354KJFAE (`m2354kjfae`) built-in target. (#1132 #1167 @ychsu-tf)\r\n- Add NXP LPC55S26 (`lpc5526`) (#1139 @stephendpmurphy)\r\n- Add NXP LPC55S36 (`lpc55s36`) and MKE17Z256xxx7 (`ke17z`) targets. (#1174 @Hoohaha)\r\n- Update SVD files for NXP i.MX RT1170. (#1171 @Lucien-Zhao)\r\n- Add micro:bit v2 board ID and Nordic nRF52833 (`nrf52833`) target.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- CMSIS DFP target: prevent creation of overlapping memory regions from different processors.\r\n- NXP i.MX RT family: fix exception in `set_reset_catch()` when there was an invalid vector table address. (#1175 @Hoohaha)\r\n- Default to using pyusb CMSIS-DAP backend for BSD OSs.\r\n- Empty YAML config files are allowed.\r\n- Made the name of picoprobe plugin all lowercase to match other plugin names.\r\n\r\n## Internal\r\n\r\n- Refactored command line interface and subcommands into separate classes under the `pyocd.subcommands` package.\r\n- Lots of little fixes to resolve code quality issues reported by LGTM.\r\n\r\nA big thanks to all contributors! \u2764\ufe0f ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pyocd/pyOCD/releases/46028840/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 6, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

Version 0.29 is the last version to support Python 2.\r\n- Removed the long since deprecated `pyocd-flashtool` and `pyocd-tool` commands. `pyocd-gdbserver` has been held back from the chopping block for another time, since it is still used by some debugger integrations.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Additions\r\n\r\n- New debug probe plugin for the Raspberry Pi picoprobe protocol. (Thanks @newbrain!)\r\n- RTOS thread awareness for ThreadX, aka Azure RTOS. (Thanks @newbrain!)\r\n- The PEMicro debug probe plugin is now a standard dependency. (Thanks @Gargy007!)\r\n- The capstone disassembly package is now a standard dependency.\r\n\r\n## Boards and targets\r\n\r\n- Add Raspberry Pi Pico, aka RP2040, target. Either of the two M0+ cores can be accessed by using the `rp2040_core0` or `rp2040_core1` target type. The `rp2040` target type is an alias for `rp2040_core0`. Both cores cannot currently be debugged simultaneously.\r\n- Add NXP LPC845 target, `lpc845`. (Thanks @Hoohaha!)\r\n- Added a family match pattern for NXP i.MX RT family devices. This means that RT device support from CMSIS-Packs will have the same workaround for reset logic as the built-in RT family target support.\r\n- Added new HDSC MCU series HC32F160 targets, `hc32f160xa` and `hc32f160xc`. (Thanks @lennvn!)\r\n- Added HDSC part numbers: `hc32f460xc` and `hc32f460xe` to HC32F460 series, and changed `hc32m423` to `hc32m423xa`. (Thanks @lennvn!)\r\n- Add some new and missing STMicro board IDs.\r\n\r\n## Changes and fixes\r\n\r\n- `GDBDebugContextFacade`: Fix misspelled `warning()` method.\r\n- J-Link: Convert \"unspecified error\" to transfer fault.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: Set default SWD number of idle cycles after each transfer to 2, per recommendations and to match other probes.\r\n- Probe server: Fix client/server `wire_protocol` property converter handling of a None value.\r\n- Dropped pywinusb dependency on Windows, in favour of hidapi that is more stable.\r\n- A few other dependency updates and changes.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: If a probe doesn't provide a serial number string, pyusb will return None. In this case, pyocd now generates a unique ID from other device info. (Thanks @mentha!)\r\n- J-Link: Removed all special handling of the `DP_SELECT` register at the J-Link probe plugin level since it is now handled in the higher DP layer. \r\n- DP: Add a couple checks of APv2 and register addresses.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: Only use extract a board ID from the USB serial number to for DAPLink firmware when reporting the probe description as for `pyocd list`.\r\n- CMSIS-Packs: Fixed off by 1 error in memory region overlap checking.\r\n- CMSIS-Packs: Handle lack of `FlashDevice` struct in .FLM files.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: read protocol version.\r\n- `CMSISDAPProbe`: trace logging.\r\n- `Flash`: trace logger for flash algo operations.\r\n- Fixes for undefined symbols identified by flake8.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: add more checks of DAP_Info responses.\r\n- Add command line alias `--project` alias for `-j` / `--dir`.\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n- SWJSequenceSender: Refactored so that parts of SWJ/JTAG transition sequences can be sent.\r\n- DebugProbe: Added `swd_sequence()` and `jtag_sequence()` APIs.\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n\r\n- Replaced Travis-CI with GitHub Actions for executing the unit tests on multiple versions of Python 3.\r\n- Add `probeserver_test.py` functional test.\r\n- Shorten `TestTimeout.no_timeout` so it doesn't fail on certain systems.\r\n- Add test binary for nRF5340-DK.\r\n\r\n"}

If this is a problem for you moving forward, please raise your concerns in the [Dropping Python 2 support discussion](https://github.com/pyocd/pyOCD/discussions/1055)._\r\n\r\n## Additions\r\n\r\n- SWO: When enabled with the new `swv_raw_enabled` option, the raw SWO data is served over TCP port 3443 by default. The port is changeable with `swv_raw_port` option. (Thanks @patrislav1)\r\n- CoreSight: Many ID table additions and renames, including adding A-profile IDs so meaningful information will be printed when connecting to an A+M multicore device.\r\n- Probe server: Added `--allow-remote` argument to enable remote access to the probe server, as it now defaults to serve local-only, like the other TCP servers.\r\n- Commander: `reset` command accepts optional reset type.\r\n- Commander: `show aps` command to list DAP Access Ports.\r\n- Architectural DAP reconnection support. `DebugPort.connect()` can be called multiple times and it will do the right thing.\r\n- MEM-AP: Support for 64-256 bit transfers when the AP has the Large Data extension. Mostly only applies to A-profile and special devices.\r\n- API: Added 64-bit memory transfers support to the memory interface API.\r\n- Add a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).\r\n\r\n## Boards and targets\r\n\r\n- Add Arm Musca-S1 target and board. (Thanks @mathias-arm)\r\n- Add WIZwiki_W7500P board ID. (Thanks @ArthurRichard)\r\n- Add NXP  i.MX RT1170 target and board. (Thanks @jhqian)\r\n- Fix NXP i.MX RT1015 memory map issue. (Thanks @Kris-b50122)\r\n- Updated NXP LPC5500 series with rev 1B debug unlock sequence. (Thanks @ttt-t3r)\r\n- Add family regex for NXP LPC5500 series, so the unlock logic will be applied to LPC5500 CMSIS-Packs.\r\n- Correct NXP LPC5500 series flash erase sector size. Even though the device supports 512-byte erase sectors, the flash algo will always erase 32 kB at a time.\r\n- For the NXP Kinetis family, ensure AP#0 is a MEM-AP before attempting to use it to test device connectivity. (Thanks @Hoohaha)\r\n- Add STMicro NUCLEO-L432KC board. (Thanks @trunet)\r\n- Correct STMicro STM32F429xG flash size. (Thanks @LONGZR007)\r\n- Correct STMicro STM32F412xE flash size. (Thanks @newbrain)\r\n\r\n## Changes and fixes\r\n\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: Flush command queue before sending SWO commands.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: Improved `swo_read()` so it only locks and flushes when using the `DAP_SWO_Data` command instead of a dedicated SWO EP (which is supported by CMSIS-DAPv2).\r\n- MEM-AP: Restructured `MEM_AP.init()` to use a single read and restore of the CSW register.\r\n- CMSIS-DAP: Truncate unused bytes of a command buffer, so CMSIS-DAPv2 bulk packets only contain the command and no padding and prevent sending zero length packets to signal the end of a transfer. (Thanks @kkitayam)\r\n- Commander: Fixed selected core for gdbserver monitor commands to match the core associated with the gdbserver, and not have multiple gdbservers interfere with one another if the selected core is changed.\r\n- Commander: Fixed \"no-init\" mode.\r\n- Commander: Fix the `probeserver` command by wrapping the `DebugProbe` instance in the shared probe proxy.\r\n- Commander: Fix `wreg` on peripheral registers.\r\n- Always use the `DebugPort` object to perform resets, except for certain cases when the `DebugPort` doesn't exist yet (mostly \"no-init\" mode of Commander), so that pre- and post-reset notifications are sent.\r\n- DP: Rename `DebugPort.init()` to `connect()`.\r\n- AP: Property and method for detecting whether the AP is enabled.\r\n- CoreSight discovery: Gracefully report failures to create CoreSight components.\r\n- CoreSight discovery: Add `adi.v5.max_invalid_ap_count` session option.\r\n- CoreSight discovery: fix a problematic error log message.\r\n- FreeRTOS: Fix r12 offset for FPU-enabled normal frame.\r\n- Numerous small fixes and code improvements to resolve issues identified by [LGTM](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/pyocd/pyOCD/?mode=list).\r\n- Add `scripts/generate_flash_algo.py` tool, copied from the [FlashAlgo](/pyocd/FlashAlgo) project and simplified.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- Some improvements to main readme.\r\n- Terminology additions.\r\n- Improve `adding_new_targets.md`.\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n\r\n- Renamed `gdb_script.py` to `gdb_test_script.py`.\r\n- Moved functional test output files to `test/output/` directory.\r\n- Add `ElfReaderContext` test to `debug_context_test.py`.\r\n- Add `commander_test.py`.\r\n- Hex-encode XML-incompatible characters in test result XML.\r\n- Fixed semihosting unit test issues.\r\n"}

This only visibly affects running system commands using gdb's `monitor` command.\r\n- Commander: Command parsing more closely matches shell command parsing. In particular, quotes are honoured within words, e.g. `hello\"my\"friend` is parsed as `hellomyfriend`. Backslash-escapes are also supported, but within quotes only quote and backslash characters can be escaped.\r\n- CortexM: Fix early exit of range step loop by step hook. This appeared as the inability to interrupt a statement step over an infinite loop in gdb in certain cases (when gdb used a range step command).\r\n- GDBServer: no longer send an unexpected response to the `k` (kill) command."}

Existing releases of pyocd will, of course, continue to work with Python 2. If this is a major issue for you moving forward, please create a [new issue](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD/issues/new/choose) describing your concerns._\r\n\r\n## Additions\r\n\r\n- Replaced the gdbserver remote monitor commands with the command set from the commander subcommand. This is the first step towards providing a full command mini-language integrated throughout pyocd.\r\n- Added support to pyocd for RTOS and debug probe plugins. Third party packages on PyPI can now add features to pyocd.\r\n- Debug probes can be shared over a TCP connection and accessed remotely. Documentation is provided in [here](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD/blob/master/docs/remote_probe_access.md).\r\n- The gdbserver subcommand adds a command line argument `--probe-server` to cause the debug probe server to be started simultaneous with the gdbserver. For allows, for instance, to connect a pyocd commander to an already-running gdbserver.\r\n- Some new core registers are exposed to the Python API and gdb: the NS versions of MSP and PSP, MSPLIM and PSPLIM for S and NS, and VPR.\r\n- Command history file support, so the history is saved between runs of pyocd commander.\r\n  - By default the history is stored in `~/.pyocd_history`. The `PYOCD_HISTORY` environment variable will override this if set.\r\n  - The default history length is 1000 entries. The `PYOCD_HISTORY_LENGTH` environment variable or `commander.history_length` option allow you to change this. Setting either one to -1 will enable an infinite history (but beware history file size).\r\n- The Arm SDC-600 Secure Debug Channel IP is supported in the internal Python API.\r\n- The v8.1-M MVE extension is detected.\r\n\r\n## Boards and targets\r\n\r\n- Added NXP MIMXRT1024-EVK, MIMXRT1060-EVK, and MIMXRT1064-EVK boards and i.MX RT1024, i.MX RT1060, and i.MX RT1064 targets (`mimxrt1024`, `mimxrt1060`, and `mimxrt1064`). (Thanks @Hoohaha)\r\n- Added new HDSC targets HC32F4A0xG, HC32F4A0xI and HC32M423 of HDSC MCU. (Thanks @lennvn)\r\n- Added OTP programming algorithm for the HDSC HC32F4A0. (Thanks @lennvn)\r\n- Added Nuvoton NuMaker-PFM-M487 board and M487JIDAE target, `m487jidae`. (Thanks @ychsu-tf)\r\n- Many fixes for NXP i.MX RT series devices related to reset and halt, as well as flash algorithms. (Thanks @Hoohaha)\r\n- Fixed HDSC HC32x120 flash algorithms. (Thanks @lennvn)\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Command changes\r\n  - Prevent accessing core registers unless core is halted. An error is printed.\r\n  - Print core security state in status command, if the core has more than one security state.\r\n  - `reg` command accepts `all` or the name of a register group in addition to register names.\r\n  - `where` command prints the offset from the base address of the symbol.\r\n  - `show register-groups` prints a list of the named groups of core registers.\r\n  - Any prefixes of a command is accepted as long as it is unique. For example, \"sym\" for \"symbol\".\r\n  - New `probeserver` command to control the debug probe server.\r\n- Vector catch supports SecureFault.\r\n- A new `reset.halt_timeout` session option controls the timeout waiting for the core to recover from reset and halt.\r\n- The standard Cortex-M system address space is used as the memory map if the target does not provide its own memory map (e.g. the `cortex_m` default target).\r\n- The full name of a detected FPU is logged. These are the names such as \"FPv4-SP-D16-M\" or \"FPv5-D16-M\".\r\n- An error will be reported if the config file (e.g., `pyocd.yaml`) does not have a yaml dictionary at its root. This helps users identify the cause of an otherwise obscure error message.\r\n- Two session options are available too control RTOS awareness in the gdbserver. `rtos.enable` can be used to completely disable RTOS support, which is enabled by default. `rtos.name` can be set to the name of an RTOS plugin in order to limit RTOS awareness to that one RTOS (which can make startup faster).\r\n- The `cache.read_code_from_elf` session option controls whether pyocd will read code from an ELF that is provided to it rather than read from the target (an optimisation that is enabled by default when an ELF is provided).\r\n- The `cmsis_dap.deferred_transfers` session options controls whether the CMSIS-DAP layer will used deferred transfers. There is generally no reason to disable this, especially since it greatly affects performance, but it may help is special cases.\r\n- The CMSIS-DAP pyusb/libusb backend will report a warning if pyusb fails to load libusb.\r\n- The `cpu.step.instruction.timeout` can be used to enable a timeout when performing instruction stepping. By default the timeout is disabled.\r\n- Handle the case where GDB sends an interrupt (Control-C) during a step or range step command.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Major fixes for ITM, SWO, and SWV support.  (Thanks @oxidecomputer)\r\n- Another fix for CMSIS-Pack flash region creation. (Thanks @menshiyu)\r\n- USB HID detach kernel driver fix for FreeBSD. (Thanks @cederom)\r\n- Fixed case of multiple Cypress target types in the board ID. This did not prevent the targets from working, but caused incorrect data to be reported via the JSON boards list query. (Thanks @mcgordonite)\r\n- Corrected detection of the Security extension on v8.1-M cores such as the Cortex-M55.\r\n- Fixed the name of the `scan_all_aps` session option in several places.\r\n- Fixed hex dump generation on Python 2 (recent regression).\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- Added [command reference](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD/blob/master/docs/command_reference.md).\r\n- Added [remote probe client/server documentation](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD/blob/master/docs/remote_probe_access.md).\r\n- Fixed download address of the GNU Arm Embedded toolchain. (Thanks @LONGZR007)\r\n- A few smaller docs improvements.\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n- Major refactoring of command system used for the commander subcommand and (now) gdbserver monitor commands. See #955 for details.\r\n- Major refactoring of the code for managing core registers. See #933 for details.\r\n- Cores have an `extensions` property that is a list of enums from `pyocd.coresight.core_ids.CortexMExtensions`.\r\n- Cores now have a `core_registers` property which is a `pyocd.core.core_registers.CoreRegisterIndex` object. This object gives you multiple ways to list and find core registers, such as by name, index, or group.\r\n- Refactored `CoreSightTarget` so there is an `SoCTarget` superclass that implements the architecture-independent SoC-level features. Moved `CoreSightTarget` under `pyocd.coresight`.\r\n- Replaced the `MemoryAccessError` exception only raised by the memory cache with `TransferFaultError`.\r\n- The `Session` class now tracks instances of the gdbservers and probeserver.\r\n- Added an optional hook callback parameter to the `Target.step()` API.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n- Moved test binaries under `test/data`.\r\n- Functional tests check for a `skip_test` session option. This would be set in per-probe options in the config file if you need to skip a probe during testing.\r\n- `automated_test.py` gains `--list-tests`, `--include-tests`, and `--exclude-tests` command line arguments.\r\n- Many functional test fixes and improvements.\r\n- New unit test for fault and flash failure exceptions.\r\n- Added a new functional test for commands.\r\n- Removed the old and entirely unused `test_pyocd_tool.sh` script.\r\n- Functional test for range step.\r\n\r\n"}

This is a new version of the Arm Debug Interface used with Cortex-M55 and in some advanced platforms. Cortex-M microcontrollers are expected to slowly transition to ADIv6, but most new MCUs will continue to use ADIv5.2 for quite some time.\r\n- Recognizing the Arm SC000, SC300, and Cortex-M35P secure cores and Cortex-M55.\r\n\r\n## Boards and targets\r\n\r\n- Added support for new revisions of secure Cypress PSoC64 devices. (Thanks @bohdan-tymkiv and Cypress.)\r\n- Added Arm Musca-S1 board ID.\r\n- Added board IDs for Arm MPS3 AN522 and AN540.\r\n- Fixed vendor name for LPC55S69 target.\r\n- LPC55S69 target supports the single-core configuration (technically LPC55S66).\r\n- Added 'lpc55s28' built-in target.\r\n- New STMicro STM32F767 target. (Thanks @bartek-w.)\r\n- Added Samsung s5js100 target. (Thanks @vince-zeng and Samsung engineers.)\r\n- Fixed reset and connect issues with a sleeping target for the NXP i.MX RT1052. (Thanks @jhqian.)\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- CMSIS-Packs: Removed the debug log message for every target loaded from a pack, which could get annoying very quickly.\r\n- User scripts: Improved logging of errors. (Thanks @bartek-w.)\r\n- Commander: The selected MEM-AP changes when the selected core is changed with the `core` command.\r\n- Commander: Help text is wrapped to the terminal width.\r\n- Commander: Reading memory with a size misaligned to the read width is disallowed.\r\n- Gdbserver: Added `--core` argument to run the gdbserver for a subset of cores.\r\n- General: The warning about `cortex_m` target type being selected is not logged if the target type was explicitly set.\r\n- General: Added `--probe` as an alias for `--uid` on the command line.\r\n- General: The `--frequency` argument accepts floating point values, and allows \"Hz\" (case-insensitive) to follow the value in addition to the previously supported metric scale suffixes. For example, `--frequency=2.2MHz` now works as expected.\r\n- Commander: The `set clock` command accepts the same values as the `--frequency` argument.\r\n- J-Link: The device type passed to the J-Link driver can be specified with the `jlink.device` option. (By default, \"Cortex-M4\" is used. This doesn't cause any problems except a warning in the J-Link log because pyOCD uses its own target discovery rather than the J-Link's.)\r\n- DAP: Code cleanup and some small improvements in MEM-AP initialization.\r\n- DAP: A `GeneralMemAPTarget` class was added that provides a target object for MEM-APs without a connected core. This handles the case where a MEM-AP provides access to either the system memory bus or an isolated memory bus, independent of MEM-APs for the core(s). (Thanks @bohdan-tymkiv and Cypress.)\r\n- STLink: Banked DP registers can be accessed on recent STLink firmware (V2J32 or V3J2 and above).\r\n- Tests: Added `concurrency_test.py` functional test.\r\n- Tests: Improve logging in some tests. (Thanks @bartek-w.)\r\n- Tests: Add process timeout for `gdb_test.py` on Python 3. (Thanks @bartek-w.)\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- DAP: Solved some long-standing concurrency issues with targets being accessed from multiple threads. Only the DAP (DP and AP) layer and below are locked. This means that the target and other high level layers are not locked. For instance, two threads attempting to set breakpoints on the same core would be unpredictable. The underlying DAP accesses and memory transfers will not fail, but the FPB component registers may get into an invalid state.\r\n- Documentation: Corrected instructions in readme for installing from the git repo.\r\n- CMSIS-Packs: Fixed problems creating the memory map for certain cases of multiple sector sizes in flash regions or regions belonging to individual cores.\r\n- General: ANSI flags are always cleared after the list of available probes is printed.\r\n- General: Memory addresses are masked to 32-bits. The most visible result of this is that you will see only a 32-bit value reported in the error if you accidentally pass a larger-width value to a read or write command (because Python intrinsically supports arbitrary-width integers).\r\n- udev rules: Fixed line endings and remove symlink directives in the STLink udev rules included in the pyOCD repo.\r\n- General: Resolved a deprecation warning for the `Thread.isAlive()` method from the Python `threading` module.\r\n"}

While Cortex-A cores are not supported yet, pyOCD can at least read the ROM tables and identify the cores now.\r\n- Support for the new SWJ sequences introduced in ADIv5.2 with SWJ-DPv2. These sequences transition between SWD and JTAG by going through a dormant mode. By default, pyOCD will first attempt the deprecated SWJ sequences, then if that fails it will attempt the new sequences.\r\n- New user options:\r\n    - `dap_protocol`: One of `swd`, `jtag`, or `default`. (JTAG is still not fully supported, but is getting closer.)\r\n    - `dap_enable_swj`: Whether SWJ sequences are sent (default True).\r\n    - `dap_use_deprecated_swj`: Whether to attempt deprecated SWJ sequences (pre-ADIv5.2). Most Cortex-M MCUs do _not_ support the new sequences.\r\n    - `probe_all_aps`: Force a scan of all 256 AP addresses instead of stopping the AP scan at the first invalid AP.\r\n    - `xpsr_control_fields`: Defines bitfields for XPSR and CONTROL registers when presented in gdb.\r\n\r\n## Boards and targets\r\n\r\n- Added board ID for Embedded Planet Agora platform.\r\n- Major refactoring of Cypress PSoC6 target support. (Thanks Cypress!)\r\n- Nordic nRF52 APPROTECT security and unlock support. This works for both builtin and CMSIS-Pack targets. (Thanks @nocko!)\r\n- Fixed NXP LPC1768 reset and halt.\r\n- Fixed Arm Musca-B1 software reset.\r\n- Added test binaries for a handful of STMicro Nucleo boards.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- More debug log messages when operations like stepping are performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed uninitialized variable reference in `FileProgrammer` that appeared when attempting to load ELF files. (#782 and others. Thanks @samkearney!)\r\n- Fixed an issue where v8-M cores would cause the commander `show cores` command to raise an exception due to separate core type name lists for v6/7-M and v8-M. There is now a single core type name list.\r\n- Improved handling of probes with multiple USB HID interfaces when using the pyusb backends.\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n- `DebugProbe.swj_sequence()` is added, plus `supports_swj_sequence` property indicating whether the probe can send arbitrary SWJ sequences using this API. Currently only CMSIS-DAP probes are capable of this.\r\n- Fixed the JTAG sequence API in pyDAPAccess. (Not exposed at higher layers.)\r\n- Renamed `link` attribute of `DebugPort` to `probe`.\r\n- Refactored `MemoryMap` region search methods.\r\n- Renamed `FlashRegion.is_erased()` to `is_data_erased()` which better reflects that it operates on passed-in data.\r\n- Changed all the constants in `Target` to be enums.\r\n- Removed the root context methods on `Target` that were unused.\r\n- Added `Target.get_halt_reason()` method.\r\n- Renamed `FlashReaderContext` to `ElfReaderContext`.\r\n- Some new `GraphNode` methods.\r\n- `MemoryCache` and `RegisterCache` were moved from `pyocd.debug.cache` to their own modules in a new subpackage `pyocd.cache`.\r\n- Moved `GDBServerPacketIOThread` to its own module.\r\n- Moved `FileProgrammer` and `FlashEraser` to their own modules under `pyocd.flash`.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- Documented `MemoryMap` methods.\r\n- New security features documentation. (Thanks @nocko!)\r\n- Split documentation of user options out from configuration documentation.\r\n- Various little fixes and improvements.\r\n"}

The breakpoint manager keep track of requested breakpoints, and only modifies the FPB/BPU immediately before a resume or step. This is useful because gdb likes to remove all breakpoints, then re-add them each time it runs the target.\r\n- Support for configuring log output. See the new [configuring logging documentation](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD/blob/master/docs/configuring_logging.md) for details.\r\n- The `pyocd list` command gained some arguments to filter the output.\r\n\r\n## Boards and targets\r\n\r\n- Added some additional NXP board IDs.\r\n- Addressed some issues with Arm Musca-A1 and Musca-B1 support.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- More helpful warning if the generic \"cortex_m\" target type is selected.\r\n- Logging of exception tracebacks can be controlled with the \"debug.traceback\" user option. Eventually this will default to false.\r\n- Removed \"soft_bkpt_as_hard\" user option. This was from long ago, before pyOCD even supported soft breakpoints, and is no longer useful.\r\n- Normalised the use of loggers, so each Python module has its own logger with the name of the module.\r\n- The debug probe's firmware version is logged via a debug log message if known.\r\n- A better error is reported if a CMSIS-Pack is not a valid zip file.\r\n- More helpful error message if an unknown target type is specified.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Workaround for .FLM flash algorithms that have a page size larger than the sector size. In particular, this fixes the Keil flash algorithms for STM32L072 and L073.\r\n- Fixed user option priorities and value parsing to work as one would expect. This is documented in the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD/blob/master/docs/configuration.md).\r\n- Fixed built-in STM32L475 flash algorithm.\r\n- Fixed some issues in the `FlashBuilder` class related to filling gaps in pages with no data to program.\r\n- Fixed `Flash.program_phrase()`.\r\n- Fixed the `CortexM.available_breakpoint_count` property.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- Finished converting all Doxygen comments to Doxygen-enabled doc comments.\r\n- Added a section about target types to the [target support documentation](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD/blob/master/docs/target_support.md).\r\n- Added [terminology definition documentation](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD/blob/master/docs/terminology.md).\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n- Added some new exception classes, tied a few outstanding exception classes into the pyOCD exception hierarchy, and made sure the appropriate exceptions are being raised for errors.\r\n- New `OptionsManager` class that handles user options for a session.\r\n- Sorted out some issues in the architecture of the `DebugContext` class.\r\n- A `Session` is now automatically opened when used as a context manager. This can be disabled by setting the `auto_open` parameter of the constructor to False. Conversely, `ConnectHelper.session_with_chosen_probe()` no longer opens the session for you (but if used in a **with** statement, the session will still be opened).\r\n- Removed deprecated parameters from `ConnectHelper.session_with_chosen_probe()`.\r\n- `Session` is the sole notifier for target-related notifications.\r\n- Added support for notifications on changes to user options. In this case, the `OptionsManager` is the notifier. For instance, to subscribe: `my_session.options.subscribe(my_cb, \"auto_unlock\")`.\r\n- Removed `root_target` attribute from `Target`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Added a basic unit test for CMSIS-Pack loading. However, it is currently disabled because it fails when run under Travis-CI.\r\n- New unit test for the notification API.\r\n- New unit test for the `OptionsManager` class.\r\n"}

A new `pack` subcommand has been added to the `pyocd` tool that lets you install packs to add target support with a single command. See #610 and the new [target support documentation](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD/blob/master/docs/target_support.md) for details.\r\n- Target auto-detection is supported for STLinkV2-1 probes (those with a USB MSD volume containing an \"mbed.htm\" file), enabling the same ease of use provided by the DAPLink firmware.\r\n- SVD support is now built-in. Most built-in targets have SVD files integrated into pyOCD, and all pack targets should support SVD. The main use right now is through the commander, where you can `show peripherals` and read or write peripheral registers by name.\r\n- The gdbserver supports the range step command from gdb. This may improve step performance slightly.\r\n\r\n## Boards and targets\r\n\r\n- Fixed a number of built-in targets where the flash algo was accidentally dropped from the flash region definition in the 0.19.0 release: lpc11xx_32, lpc11u24, lpc1768, lpc54114, lpc54608, lpc824, kl28z, stm32f429xx, stm32f439xx.\r\n- Adjusted Musca targets' memory map to work around chip errata.\r\n- Fixed page size and enabled double buffering for some built-in STM32 targets: stm32f412xx, stm32f429xx, stm32f439xx, stm32l031xx.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Logging more information about the DP and AP types and versions.\r\n- More changes to reduce the amount of libusb related log messages. Many debug messages were removed, and warnings about possible permissions issues are only logged once per device per process.\r\n- Added `debug.log_flm_info` user option to log debug messages with details of .FLM flash algorithms.\r\n- Commander `show map` command prints both sector and page sizes.\r\n- A universal wheel of pyOCD is now released to PyPI in addition to the source distribution.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Flash programming will not attempt to read data from flash regions that are marked as non-readable.\r\n- Fixed the `get_probe_with_id()` APIs on debug probes.\r\n- Correctly decoding the USB serial number for certain versions of STLinkV2 where the serial number is incorrectly encoded.\r\n- Catching additional errors that could be thrown by USB devices when checking to see if they provide a CMSIS-DAPv2 interface.\r\n- Commander `savemem` command inits the flash algo when accessing flash regions with `is_powered_on_boot` flash set to false.\r\n- High level flash erase operations, e.g. via `pyocd erase`, correctly deal with sector and page sizes being different.\r\n- Invalid CMSIS-Pack paths are handled gracefully with a warning log message, but pyOCD continues executing (unless the selected target type is in the missing pack, in which case you'll get an unknown target type error).\r\n- Removed websocket-client and future packages from requirements.\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n- The most recently created `Session` instance is accessible via `Session.get_current()`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Fixed `basic_test.py` for flash regions with small number of sectors.\r\n- `flash_loader_test.py` fixes.\r\n"}

This is required due to a change in the v8-M TPIU that requires the trace clock to be active before accessing certain registers.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- The NXP LPC-LinkII debug probe is recognized properly.\r\n- Worked around apparent libusb issue in Windows where STLink probes would intermittently not be visible (#575).\r\n- Corrected handling of error responses from STLink probes (#581). This also fixes problems with the latest STLink firmware version (V2J33M25).\r\n- Fixed a problem introduced recently where probes running the old \"mbed CMSIS-DAP\" firmware was not recognized (#588).\r\n- Fixed CMSIS-Pack targets not working with `pyocd-gdbserver` (#570).\r\n- Fixed `--no-init` option for commander.\r\n- Fixed the default value for the gdbserver's `vector_catch` option. If the option was not set, an exception was raised.\r\n- Corrected `GDBServer.stop()` so it no longer uninits the board.\r\n- Commander `disasm` command works while the target is running.\r\n- The `--help-options` argument no longer fails for user options that have multiple allowed types, such as `pack`.\r\n- Fixed `LOG_DAP` functionality in `pyocd.coresight.ap`.\r\n- Updated pyyaml requirement to >= 5.1 (#582). The entire 4.1 release series that pyOCD was pinned to turned out to be buggy (though it didn't seem to affect pyOCD's usage).\r\n- Fixed `FileProgrammer` trying to raise the undefined `ArgumentError` exception for errors. It now raises the standard `ValueError`.\r\n- Fixed a number of issues with how `FileProgrammer` checked for file errors, including file not found (#590).\r\n- Fixed default names for memory regions.\r\n- Fixed a problem where `FileProgrammer` used programmatically would not default to sector erase.\r\n- Access permissions are set on memory regions created for Pack targets.\r\n- Fixed the `selected_core` property setter on `CoreSightTarget`.\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n- Added optional `init_board` parameter to `Session.open()` to control whether the board (and therefore target) are initialized. Used to implement the commander `--no-init` option.\r\n- Removed `STLinkException` from the STLink probe code; now using standard pyOCD exceptions.\r\n- Added page and phrase sizes and program and erase weight attributes to flash memory regions.\r\n- Added `smart_flash` and `keep_unwritten` parameters to `FileProgrammer` and `FlashLoader`.\r\n- `AccessPort` methods are automatically serialized via a mutex.\r\n- Changing the HPROT and HNONSEC values used for MEM-AP transfers is supported.\r\n- `MEM_AP` attempts to detect the supported HPROT and HNONSEC bits in CSW.\r\n- `AHB_AP` detects whether the MSTRTYP bit is supported in CSW. (Only the M3/M4 AHB-AP supports this bit.)\r\n- Added context manager methods to `MEM_AP` to temporarily change HPROT or HNONSEC. The AP is locked while the context manager is live.\r\n- Moved the CoreSight components list to a separate source file.\r\n- New `CortexM_v8M` subclass for v8-M cores.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- Updated [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and removed mention of the contributor license agreement that no longer needs to be signed.\r\n- Added readme to [udev](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD/tree/master/udev) folder with detailed information.\r\n- The udev section in the main readme was simplified.\r\n- Link to GNU Arm Embedded toolchain in a couple places.\r\n- Updated the architecture diagram.\r\n- Note about `gdb_test.py` requiring 32-bit Python 2.7 on Windows.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Testing both 8- and 32-bit transfers in `speed_test.py`.\r\n- `speed_test.py` limits the size it will read or write during testing to 1 MB.\r\n- Rewrote the simple flash erase/program test in `basic_test.py` to support nonequal erase/program sizes.\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\n- The LPC-LinkII probe may not work correctly under Windows using pywinusb.\r\n- All new v8-M targets have certain issues with flash programming or other operations.\r\n"}

It now says, \"\"Board ID XXXX is not recognized; you will be able to use pyOCD but not program flash.\"\r\n- The SWV reader supports 16- and 32-bit ITM channel 0 events that send multiple characters.\r\n- pyOCD only attempts to read the board ID from the probe's USB serial number if it knows the probe is running DAPLink, by comparing the USB VID and PID. This prevents unknown board ID warnings for other CMSIS-DAP compatible probes.\r\n- pyOCD is now aware that a board ID of \"0000\" means the DAPLink is generic, so it won't try to look up the matching board.\r\n- Removed websocket support.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed a failure to start SWO transfers from the probe by sending the command to stop SWO before starting it. The failure could happen if the probe was left with SWO running when pyOCD exited, and then pyOCD was started again.\r\n- Updated Argon RTOS support to match the latest version.\r\n- Fixed an issue that prevented SWO from working with CMSIS-DAPv1.\r\n- The SWV reader checks that the probe supports SWO before attempting to enable it.\r\n- The `trace_start()` delegate and user script method will be called by the SWV reader if the target is reset.\r\n- Fixed memory cache bugs that caused duplication of cache contents. This most often appeared as extra data being sent by the gdbserver in response to a gdb read memory command, though it was not visible to users.\r\n- Fixed the `FlashReaderContext` class' usage of a removed intervaltree API. This problem would be triggered if you passed `pyocd gdbserver` an ELF file.\r\n- Any enabled watchpoints are removed on disconnect.\r\n- The list of valid APs is saved only after the full AP scan completes, to prevent a partial list being saved.\r\n- Rewrote gdbserver memory read command handler to use a much simpler and more efficient hex encoding method.\r\n- Catching `NotImplementedError` exceptions raised on Windows by the CMSIS-DAPv2 interface code.\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n- Memory map API now allows empty memory ranges, but not empty memory regions.\r\n- Removed `has_fpu` attribute from the `Target` class. This attribute is only supported on `CortexM` now.\r\n- `is_float_register()` returns true for both single and double precision float registers.\r\n- Added a setter for the `CoreSightTarget.selected_core` property. The `select_core()` method is now deprecated.\r\n- Changed the name of the `format` parameter of `FileProgrammer.program()` to `file_format` so it doesn't shadow the builtin function.\r\n- Refactored `GDBSocket` into `pyocd.utility.socket.ListenerSocket`.\r\n- Renamed `pyocd.utility.py3_helpers` module to `pyocd.utility.compatibility`.\r\n- Removed unused `Flash_cortex_m` class.\r\n- A few remaining timeouts were changed to use the `Timeout` class.\r\n- Got rid of a pointless mutex in `GDBServer`.\r\n- Removed reading of flash related user options from `GDBServer` since these are now handled elsewhere.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- Renamed files in the `docs/` folder to all lower case.\r\n- Started process of converting doxygen comments to doxygen-enabled doc comments.\r\n- Added some missing user options to docs.\r\n- Fixed some errors and typos in `user_scripts.md` and delegate method doc comments.\r\n- Converted license headers to use single-line comments, mostly so they don't show up in Doxygen output.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Set up tox for running functional tests under Python 2.7 and 3.7. This will soon be used in our CI system to test on both Python versions.\r\n- Moved unit tests from the pyocd Python package to the `test/` folder in the repo root.\r\n- Added tests to cover memory cache bugs mentioned above.\r\n- `flash_loader_test.py` tests hex file programming.\r\n- `speed_test.py` tests cached memory accesses and records the ROM read speed.\r\n- `cortex_test.py` reports test metrics.\r\n- Removed use of `test_boards.yaml` file in favour of the now-standard `pyocd.yaml` config file.\r\n- Fixed `blank_test.py`.\r\n- New `debug_context_test.py`.\r\n"}

This feature is documented in [docs/user_scripts.md](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD/blob/master/docs/user_scripts.md).\r\n- Providing the foundation for user scripts, the Python API supports attaching a delegate object to the session and other objects such as the target and cores. The same hook functions are used for delegates and user scripts.\r\n- SWO and SWV are now supported for both CMSIS-DAP and STLink. See the description of #543 for details.\r\n- CMSIS-DAPv2 support. v2 uses bulk endpoints instead of HID for improved latency. Tested with the Keil ULINKplus.\r\n- Sessions have the concept of a project directory. This directory defaults to the working directory where pyOCD was started. It can be changed with the `-j/--dir` command line argument or `project_dir` user option. Any files used by pyOCD, such as config files, user scripts, or .FLM flash algos, will be searched for in the project directory if they are specified as a relative path.\r\n\r\n## Boards and targets\r\n\r\n- Added STM32F429xI.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- The objects in the pyOCD object graph are now linked to form a generic object graph, in addition to the explicit references that already exist. This is intended to make it easier to find objects as the graph gets much more complex with support for SWO and other CoreSight components.\r\n- The path to an .FLM style flash algorithm can be set on a `FlashRegion` via the `flm` property. pyOCD will then load the flash algorithm for you. Very useful for user scripts.\r\n- Renamed the `flash_algo` property of `FlashRegion` to just `algo` and made it and `flash_class` settable. This is all to make it easy to set or modify the flash algo in user scripts and delegates.\r\n- Renamed `SESSION_OPTIONS.md` documentation file to `CONFIGURATION.md` since it covers all configuration topics and not just a list of options.\r\n- Added ULINKplus to example udev rules.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed a typo in the code to build a flash algo from an .FLM file, which caused STM32 CMSIS-Pack targets to not be able to program flash.\r\n- Corrected a performance issue for Python 3 on Windows and Linux. The pywinusb and pyusb backends for CMSIS-DAP were not yielding to other threads while waiting for data.

This happened to not cause problems when using the gdbserver.\r\n- Set the encoding to UTF-8 when `setup.py` reads the `README.md` file, which fixes issues on systems that have an incompatible default system encoding.\r\n- Pinned all dependencies that have stable APIs (version >=1.0).\r\n- Corrected the flash algorithm call sequence to match the specification. This means calling `Init()` with the operation to be performed (erase or program), and calling `Uninit()` then `Init()` again prior to performing a different operation. Unfortunately, this change affects flash programming performance, slowing it down by approximately 5 kB/s. This performance degradation will be addressed soon.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Expanded `cortex_test.py` to cover both the raw and non-raw versions of the read/write register APIs."}

See the [session options](docs/SESSION_OPTIONS.md) documentation for details on config files.\r\n- Reasonable start on documentation for pyOCD in the `docs/` folder.\r\n- Breaking changes to board-related classes.\r\n  - New `Session` class is now the object graph root. This class holds references to the debug probe and board instances, and owns session user options.\r\n  - New `ConnectHelper` class with static methods previously in `MbedBoard`.\r\n  - New `DebugProbe` class hierarchy under `pyocd.probe` adds architectural support for multiple debug probe types and separates probe and board functionality.\r\n  - Moved pyDAPAccess under `pyocd.probe`.\r\n- Breaking changes to API names, to bring names into PEP8 compliance.

Thread names are now provided by the `name` attribute in the gdbserver threads XML report rather than the thread description. This attribute is supported in gdb 7.10 and later, and is ignored in earlier versions.\r\n- RTX5 thread status for blocked threads uses \"Waiting\" terminology rather than \"Blocked\".\r\n- Zephyr thread names will now be reported.\r\n- xPSR registers (apsr, iapsr, eapsr, ipsr, epsr, iepsr) can be read and written with core register APIs.\r\n- Made `DebugContext` and `Target` both subclasses of `MemoryInterface`.\r\n- The active exception or interrupt is shown in the Handler mode thread description.

Objects can subscribe to notifications on the target objects and be informed of target state changes (reset, run, step, etc).\r\n- Introduced a workaround for stale RTOS data. This mostly eliminates occurrences of garbage thread lists when loading a new ELF, but device RAM still has valid RTOS structures from the previous version of the code.\r\n- Improvements to `pyocd-tool`.\r\n  - set/show help will print appropriate list of available keys.\r\n  - Support for `help set <name>` and `help show <name>`.\r\n  - `show fault`, `show step-into-interrupt`, `show vector-catch`\r\n  - pyocd-tool no longer waits for SVD loading before showing the first prompt.\r\n  - new `initdp` and `makeap` commands.\r\n  - A few small bug fixes related to print hex values or hex dumps.\r\n- Added example udev rule for Linux to readme, and a debug log message when lack of permissions seem to be preventing device access.\r\n- Flash programming progress improved for non-TTY output streams, such as Eclipse.\r\n"}
