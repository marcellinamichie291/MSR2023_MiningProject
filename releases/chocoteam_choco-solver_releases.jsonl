the search finding a first solution. See `solver.addHint(var, val)`.\r\n- Add `Solver.tableSampling` resolution policy which returns a stream of `Solution` randomly sampled.\r\n- Add `increasing` and `decreasing` constraints\r\n- Add `costFlow` constraint, which is composed of scalar products and a MinCostMaxFlow propagator\r\n- Revamp `pow` constraint\r\n- Add threshold for `element` with array of variables signature\r\n- Add a propagator for 0/1-knapsack (thanks to @PoltyPoltou)\r\n- Remove `CPProfiler` since the project is not active anymore.\r\n- Make possible to deal with large domains for some constraints (#894)\r\n- Add a `LinearProgram` class to deal with linear program (!) and a two-phase Simplex (not connected yet)\r\n- Fix bug related to delta in boolean views\r\n- Improvements relative to reified propagators\r\n- Change signature of AtLeastNValues\r\n- Record time to best in `Measures(IMeasures measures)` constructor\r\n \r\n####  Change the way propagators are stored in variables to ease swapping (#889)\r\nEach variable is in charge of scheduling its propagators. \r\nThis impacts the way propagators are stored in a variable. \r\nConsequently, the `getPropagators()` and `getPropagator(int)` methods are deprecated, `streamPropagators()` replaces them. \r\nUnless otherwise stated, a propagator that can be entailed is automatically swapped in its variables' internal structure.\r\n\r\n#### SetVar\r\n- Extend some black-box strategies to `SetVar`\r\n- Add `union(SetVar unionSet, SetVar indices, SetVar[] sets)` constraint\r\n- Add free strategy for SetVar (RegParser and ParallelPortfolio)\r\n- Fix `SetVar#getDomainSize`\r\n- Add `SetDomainMax`\r\n- Add 'setLe' and 'setLt' constraint (as a decomposition) in `ISetConstraintFactory`\r\n\r\n#### Flatzinc, XCSP3 and MPS\r\n- Change default search of Flatzinc\r\n- Increase interval for Flatzinc unbounded intvar\r\n- Remove default ANSI in parsers\r\n- Update FZN grammar to deal with 'set of int'\r\n- Flatzinc: deal with warm_start\r\n- Add ignored search annotation warning in FGoal\r\n- Update XCSPParser + add `model.amongDec`\r\n\r\n### JAR Files\r\nSince 4.10.9, a new jar file is available for download. \r\nThis is a lighter version of the one with dependencies, \r\nnamely `choco-parsers-light-VERSION.jar`.\r\nThe following dependencies have been excluded from this archive:\r\n- `org.apache.pdfbox:pdfbox`\r\n- `org.apache.fontbox:fontbox`\r\n- `com.ibm.icu:icu4j`\r\n\r\nThis results in 82% smaller archive.\r\nNote that the non-alleged versions are still available for download.\r\n\r\n### Deprecated API (to be removed in next release):\r\n- `IOutputFactory.outputSearchTreeToCPProfiler(boolean domain)`\r\n\r\n### Other closed issues and pull requests:\r\nSee [milestone 4.10.9](https://github.com/chocoteam/choco-solver/milestone/xx)\r\n\r\n#### Contributors to this release:\r\n- [Mathieu Vavrille](https://github.com/MathieuVavrille) (@MathieuVavrille)\r\n- [Nicolas Pierre](https://github.com/PoltyPoltou) (@PoltyPoltou)\r\n- [Charles Prud'homme](https://github.com/cprudhom) (@cprudhom)\r\n- [Jean-Guillaume Fages](https://github.com/jgFages) (@jgFages)\r\n- [Arthur Godet](https://github.com/ArthurGodet) (@ArthurGodet)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/chocoteam/choco-solver/releases/74979386/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "mentions_count": 5}

`solver.observePropagation(PropagationObserver)`. \r\nConsequently, it is now possible to profil the propagation by calling `solver.profilePropagation()`. \r\nSee Javadoc for details and usages (#832).\r\n- Release 4.10.7 introduces a bug related to delta monitors, which is now fixed (#837).\r\n- Add new black-box strategy: failure based variable ordering heuristics (@lihb905)\r\n- Add `model.streamVars()` and `model.streamCstrs()`\r\n- Bounded domains checking for table constraints\r\n- Change complementary search in FlatZincParser\r\n- Bump XCSP3\r\n\r\n### Other closed issues and

There is no need to `freeze` and `unfreeze` \r\nthem before calling `forEach...` methods. But, a call to `forEach...` consumes all values stored.\r\n- Fix a bug related to incremental propagators, views and missing events.\r\n- STR2+ now deals with STAR tuples. Can be used when CT+ is not efficient (mainly due to very large domain size)\r\n- Resetting cutoff strategies now possible\r\n- Change restart behavior to reset cutoff on solutions (can be disabled though, calling `solver.setRestarts(..)` API).\r\n- Display occurrences of variable types and occurrences of propagator types\r\n- Now `IntDomainBest` offers API to break ties (see `Search.ValH.BLAST` for an example).\r\n- Add `solver.defaultSolution()` which creates lazily a solution recording everything, plugs it and returns it. \r\nThis is helpful when a Solution object is required in many places. \r\n- Modification of the management of expressions in order to reduce the number of created variables (WIP).\r\n- Add `IntVar.stream()` that streams a variable's values (in increasing order)\r\n- Add `Search.ValH.BMIN` and `Search.ValH.BLAST`\r\n- Add DIMACS CNF parser (`org.chocosolver.parser.mps.ChocoDIMACS`)\r\n- Add Logger (`solver.log()`) to trace from Model/Solver.\r\n- Change some default settings\r\n- Revamp `Settings`, now is defined as a factory pattern + add `Settings.dev()` and `Settings.prod()` profiles.\r\n- Make *half reification* possible. Seed `c.implies(b)` or `c.impliedBy(b)` \r\n  where `c` is a Constraint and `b` a BoolVar.\r\n- Update MiniZinc constraints definition + flatzinc files (for testing).\r\n- Update `choco.msc` (for MiniZinc IDE) + `./minizinc/README.md`   \r\n- Add `Argmax` and `Argmin` constraints\r\n- Add `IfThenElse` as a decomposed constraint\r\n- Improvement of `solver.findParetoFront()`\r\n\r\n### Deprecated API (to be removed in next release):\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other closed issues and pull requests:\r\nSee [milestone 4.10.7](https://github.com/chocoteam/choco-solver/milestone/xx)\r\n\r\n#### Contributors to this release:\r\n- [Dimitri Justeau-Allaire](https://github.com/dimitri-justeau) (@dimitri-justeau)\r\n- [Jean-Guillaume Fages](https://github.com/jgFages) (@jgFages)\r\n- [Charles Prud'homme](https://github.com/cprudhom) (@cprudhom) \r\n- [Charles Vernerey](https://github.com/ChaVer) (@chaver)", "mentions_count": 4}

`findOptimalSolutionWithBounds`. See Javadoc for details and usages.\r\n- `ParallelPortfolio` now allows to add *unreliable* models, that is models whose resolution is deliberately made incomplete. \r\nThese models should not stop the parallel resolution process when they no longer find a solution. \r\nOnly complete models can inform the portfolio that they have proven the full exploration of the search space. \r\n- Add `org.chocosolver.util.tools.PreProcessing` class, and a first preprocessing rule: equalities detection\r\n- Upgrade ibex integration to support ibex-java [v1.2.0](https://github.com/ibex-team/ibex-java/releases/tag/1.2.0). \r\nFixes for issues #653 and #740. \r\n- Add QuickXPlain algorithm to find the Minimum Conflicting Set (see issue #509)\r\n- Update XCSP3 parser.\r\n- Fix `InDomainMedian` when domain size is even\r\n- Add new way to watch solving: `solver.verboseSolving()`\r\n- Deal with annotations for some Flatzinc constraints (allDifferent and inverse)\r\n- Add `MultiArmedBandit` strategy sequencer\r\n\r\n\r\n### Deprecated API (to be removed in next release):\r\n\r\n### Other closed issues and pull requests:\r\nSee [milestone 4.10.6](https://github.com/chocoteam/choco-solver/milestone/30)\r\n\r\n#### Contributors to this release:\r\n- [Charles Prud'homme](https://github.com/cprudhom) (@cprudhom)\r\n- [Jo\u00e3o Pedro Schmitt](https://github.com/schmittjoaopedro) (@schmittjoaopedro) ", "mentions_count": 2}

In the following, the major modifications are reported in order to ease code migration. \n\n_See also [closed issues](#cissues)._\n\nEven though we first wanted to provide an automatic script to help migration, we finally preferred to list the code modifications needed to move from 3 to 4.\nThe documentation is up-to-date and may be a good starting point.\n\n**Note that most IDEs now provide helpful tools to help code migration**.\n\n# At a glance\n\nIn order to distinguish resolution steps, `Solver` and `SearchLoop` now move to respectively `Model` and `Solver`.\n- `Model` aims at declaring a problem on the basis of variables and constraints, and replaces the dedicated factories. \n- `Solver` mainly focuses on the resolution of the declared problem, using less factories . \n\n#

solver);` | `IntVar x = model.intVarMatrix(\"X\", 3, 4, new int[]{0,2,4});` |\n\n### fixed\n\nThe way constants are declared does not depend on the type (fixed or variable) but on the kind (integer, set, ...).\n\n| v3.3.3 | v4.0.0 |\n| --- | --- |\n| `IntVar zero = VariableFactory.fixed(0, solver);` | `IntVar zero = model.intVar(0);` |\n| `IntVar zero = VariableFactory.fixed(\"0\", 0, solver);` | `IntVar zero = model.intVar(\"0\", 0);` |\n\n## <a name=\"setrealvar\">`SetVar`  and `RealVar`</a>\n\nSimilar modifications were applied to `SetVar` and `RealVar` declaration, _e.g._:\n\n| v3.3.3 | v4.0.0 |\n| --- | --- |\n| `SetVar s = VariableFactory.set(\"S\", new int[]{0,3}, new int[]{0, 1, 2, 3}, solver);` | `SetVar s = model.setVar(\"S\", new int[]{0,3}, new int[]{0, 1, 2, 3});` |\n| `RealVar r = VariableFactory.real(\"R\", 0.1d, 2.2d, solver);` | `RealVar r = model.realVar(\"R\", 0.1d, 2.2d);` |\n\n## <a name=\"taskvar\">`Task`</a>\n\nA `TaskVar` now have to be created calling `new Task(IntVar start, IntVar duration, IntVar end)`.\n\n## <a name=\"views\">  Views</a>\n\nWays to create views evolved too, the signature are now :\n- `model.intAbsView(IntVar)`,\n- `model.intMinusView(IntVar)`,\n- `model.intOffsetView(IntVar)`,\n- `model.intScaleView(IntVar)`,\n- `model.boolNotView(IntVar)`,\n- `model.realIntView(IntVar)`\n\n# <a name=\"constraints\"> Constraints</a>\n\nConstraints can be created thanks to a model.\nFor example, \n\n``` java\nsolver.post(IntConstraintFactory.alldifferent(xs));\n```\n\nnow becomes:\n\n``` java\nmodel.post(model.allDifferent(xs));\n```\n\nor, in a more convenient way:\n\n``` java\nmodel.allDifferent(xs).post();\n```\n\nMost of the names and signatures remain the same between the two versions (but not all, see for instance `alldifferent` is now `allDifferent`).\n\n## <a name=\"reification\">Reifying</a>\n\nNothing really change here, expect the way constraints are created:\n\n``` java\nBoolVar b = model.allDifferent(xs).reify();\n```\n\nNote that `Model` provides APIs like `model.ifThenElse(Constraint, Constraint, Constraint)`.\n\n## <a name=\"clauses\">Clauses</a>\n\nModel offers possibilities to directly add clauses to the clause-store, like `model.addClauses***(...)` where `***` indicates the expression to turn into clauses.\n\n# <a name=\"solver\">`Solver`</a>\n\n`SearchLoop` now becomes `Solver`. \n\n``` java\nSolver solver = model.getSolver();\n```\n\nThis class provides APIs to configure the search and the resolution process.\n\nv3.3.3 APIs to solve problem, like `solver.findSolution()`.\nHowever, the returning value has changed, from `boolean` to `Solution`.\n\n`Solver` now provides another API to solve a problem, named `solve()` which looks for a feasible solution.\nIt can be called as long as it returns `true`. In that case, the resolution process stops **on** a solution state, which means that variables are instantiated and their domain can be read.\n\nPrinting solutions or resolution statistics is not done thanks to a factory anymore, but directly with the solver, _e.g._:\n`solver.showDecisions();`\n\nThe same goes with measures, directly reachable from the solver, _e.g_:\n`solver.getBackTrackCount();`\n\nSolver `hasReachedLimit()` moved to `isStopCriterionMet()` (since limit were renamed criterion so far, both method act similarly).\nMoreover, `Solver.getState()` which returns one of those states:\n- `NEW`: when the problem is established but the resolution has not been triggered yet ;\n- `RUNNING`: when the solver is searching for a solution ; \n- `TERMINATED`: the search ends normally, a solution is found or the entire search tree was explored without finding any solution ;\n- `STOPPED` : the search was stopped by a limit ; \n- `KILLED` : the resolution was killed from the outside (eg, thread interruption, JVM killed)\n\n`Solver`'s setters signatures have changed to be more accurate, _e.g._:\n`solver.set(mySearchStrategy)` becomes `solver.setSearch(mySearchStrategy)`\n\n`IntSearchStrategy` and similar were merged into `Search`, which provides widely used search strategies.\nMaking dedicated combination of variable selector and value selector may imply to create object calling `new` instruction.\n\n# <a name=\"cissues\">Closed issues</a>\n\n#427, #433, #438, #448, #450, #456 \n"}

Doing so, the models are sure to the same and reduces the risk of errors\n- add a search monitor helper for parallel resolution with Java8 lambda (#293)\n- lazy creation of ZERO, ONE, TRUE and FALSE through methods of `Solver` (#293)\n- refactor `Solution` (#306)\n- improve propagator iteration in propagation engine\n- revamp `IMeasures` to avoid declaring its concrete class as monitor\n- remove deprecated classes: `GenerateAndTest`, `LastConflict_old`\n- add new API to `Solver` to declare eagerly the objective variable(s) and the precision\n- enable printing decisions and solutions in ANSI colors (see `Settings.outputWithANSIColors()`)\n- add connection to [cp-profiler](https://github.com/cp-profiler/cp-profiler) (#341)\n\n#### Search:\n- Deeply revamp the search loop to offer more flexibility \n- `SearchLoop.interrupt()`is now forbidden\n- `AbstractStrategy.init()` cannot throw `ContradictionException` anymore but returns false instead\n- revamp decisions to enable `IntMetaDecision` \n- change Decision's API, `getDecisionVariable()` becomes `getDecisionVariables()`\n- move `FastDecision` to `../IntDecision`\n- revamp `IntDecision.toString()`\n- set `DecisionOperator` as an interface (instead of an abstract class)\n- `org.chocosolver.solver.search.limits.ICounter` and its concrete class have been revisited, a `Solver` is now needed to create them.\n\n#### Variables:\n- add `IntVar.removeValues(IntIterableSet, ICause)`, `IntVar.removeAllValuesBut(IntIterableSet, ICause)`\n  and `IntVar.updateBounds(int, int, ICause) (#270)`\n- improve `IntVar.removeInterval(int, int, ICause)` for enumerated domain integer variables\n- prevent the user from using `ISF.random_value` on bounded vars\n\n#### Constraints:\n- add `keysorting()` constraint\n- add `int_value_precede_chain()` constraint\n- improve \"DEFAULT\" option for `ICF.alldifferent()`\n- revamp scalar and sum (#324)\n- fix lack of filtering in `PropMin`\n- simplify and improve basic element propagator (#325)\n- remove `aCause` from `Propagator`, should be replaced by `this`\n- simplify `Propagation.contradiction(...)`\n- add new setting to Settings to allow to not clone variables array input to Propagator's constructor\n- `Propagator.getPropagationConditions()` becomes public\n\n#### Explanations:\n- deal with unary decision (when once is set to true)\n- add `PoolManager` for `Rules` and `Propagators`\n- explain `PropCount_AC`\n- fix lack of explanations in `SatSolver`\n- fix `PropLessOrEqualXY_C` to add the right rule\n\n#### Bug fixes:\n\n#152, #153, #164, #176, #296, #297, #298, #301, #303, #309, #311, #313, #314, #317, #320, #323, #326, #327, #331, #333, #334, #337, #338, #342\n"}
