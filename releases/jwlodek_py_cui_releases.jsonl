It also drops support for python versions older than 3.6, improves some logging message levels, overhauls the widget ID system, and adds a large amount of various bug-fixes and other minor new features. Please see the more detailed breakdown and issue list below.\r\n\r\n**What this pull request changes**\r\n\r\n* Live-Debug mode added. When enabled, a certain keybinding (default `Ctrl-D`) will open up an overlay widget with recent logger messages displayed. Log messages buffered up until a certain maximum. Standard logging levels are supported. Will make debugging UI issues and especially `py_cui` development much easier.\r\n* Support for variety of mouse functions - left/right/middle clicks, double clicks, triple clicks, presses and releases\r\n* Allow for user setting of mouse commands like key commands\r\n* Allow setting an on-selection-change event function for scroll menus\r\n* Python versions older than 3.6 dropped from support. I had wanted to keep around support for older versions due to the vintage of OS I used at work - but we have recently migrated everything to RHEL 8, giving me an excuse to drop older versions\r\n* Some changes to log message levels\r\n* Change to widget ID system - widgets now just get integers as IDs, this is cleaner\r\n* Add ability to \"forget\" a widget and remove it from an active UI\r\n\r\n### Issues Fixed\r\n\r\n* #106 \r\n* #58 \r\n* #109 \r\n* #98 \r\n* #115 \r\n* #113\r\n* #100\r\n* #72 \r\n* #126 \r\n* #119 \r\n* #114 \r\n* #107\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* There should be no major outward facing breaking changes with this release", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jwlodek/py_cui/releases/52345928/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}
