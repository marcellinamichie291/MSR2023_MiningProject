Non-Maximum suppression's documentation now clearly states that it suppresses only if adjacent pixel is\n  less than.  This is not true non-maximum suppression since it allows equal values but seems to produce\n  better results\n  - Improved unit tests to explicitly test for this behavior\n- Canny edge detector would fail if threshold was zero and the image had no texture\n  - HysteresisEdge\\* code was using a value of 0 to mark traversed regions.  It now uses -1 and sanity checks\n    the lower threshold.\n  - Thanks Lucaro for finding this bug\n- Added GImageMultiBand for generalized access to multi-band image data\n- Added support for MultiSpectral images to:\n  - GBlurImageOps and BlurImageOps\n- Image Segmentation / Superpixels\n  - Watershed\n  - Mean-shift\n  - Felzenszwalb-Huttenlocher 2004\n  - SLIC Superpixels\n- Dense Optical Flow\n  - KLT Based\n  - Square Region Based\n  - Horn Schunck\n  - Horn Schunck Pyramid\n  - Brox Spacial Warping\n- Fixed bugs in ConvertNV21\n  - Was applying YV12 byte alignment to NV21 images.  Depending on image size, this could cause a crash.\n- Fixed bug in ImplConvertToBitmap.multiToArray_F32()\n  - Didn't handle case where the input image has 3 bands and not 4\n- ImageBase now provides a method for getting ImageType information\n- Threshold in the interface Associate is now <= instead of <\n- Android\n  - Added classes which greatly simplify dealing with camera previews\n  - Added new visualizations intended for use with segmented images\n  - Simplified example code\n- Added XYZ and LAB color spaces\n- GImageMiscOps.fillUniform() max is inclusive for both integer and float and this is enforced\n- BinaryImageOps\n  - Erode and dilate can now be applied multiple times with a single function call\n- StitchingFromMotion2D can now resize and translate the stitch image\n  - Thanks Julien Seinturier for the suggestion\n- Convolution\n  - 1D convolution now supports kernels which are not symmetric\n- Image gradient from a difference of two neighbors added\n- Square grid calibration grid detector has been improved.\n  - No longer permutes through all combinations.  Selects each valid square and assumes its the first instead\n  - Graph connection rule has been improved too to reduce false connections\n- Moved serializeXML from BoofMiscOps to UtilIO\n  - Removing an IO function which shouldn't be in image processing\n- FactoryDerivative\n  - If derivative type is null it will use the default\n- Added ImageType to interpolate interface\n- Added ImageType to ImageSegmentation interface\n- Processing (http://processing.org) integration\n  - Lots of examples\n  - Simplified interface for working with BoofCV\n- XStream now works without that ugly hack\n  - Thanks to J\u00f6rg Schaible of XStream for fixing the issue and all the help\n- Webcam Capture Support\n  - Easy to use library for streaming webcams\n  - Wrote several example showing how Webcam Capture can be used with BoofCV\n- Structure From Motion (SFM) example\n"}
