The vocabulary id should no longer include a language specifier, which has been the practice until now. The language of the labels of subject suggestions is now defined by the project's language setting, or it can be overridden in a project by giving the language code in parentheses after the vocabulary id (e.g. `vocab=lcsh(en)` in a Finnish language project). These changes break the backward compatibility of existing projects and vocabularies.\r\n\r\nThe CLI command for loading a vocabulary has changed: the command is now `annif load-vocab` to align with the other annif commands and its first argument is a vocabulary id instead of a project id. When loading a vocabulary from a TSV file the  `--language` option needs to be given to set the language. A command `annif list-vocabs` is introduced for listing vocabularies. The old `annif loadvoc` command still works in this release, but it has been deprecated and will be removed in the next Annif release.\r\n\r\nThe CLI commands are now documented in a [page on the ReadTheDocs](https://annif.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/commands.html) instead of the Annif wiki. The development installations of Annif now use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for managing Python virtual environments and dependencies. There are also a few other minor changes, including an upgrade to Simplemma v0.8 series that introduced support for new languages.\r\n\r\nNote also that we are starting to prepare for Annif 1.0 release. For this purpose we have opened the [issue #616](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/issues/616) for discussing the expectations of backward compatibility and Semantic Versioning in releases beyond 1.0.\r\n\r\n## Backward compatibility\r\nThe changes in the vocabulary functionality require **reloading of previously loaded vocabularies** and **retraining of existing models**.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n#559/#600 Make vocabularies multilingual\r\n#602/#614 Implement `load-vocab` and `list-vocabs` commands\r\n#603/#610 Store vocabs in AnnifRegistry so they are shared between projects\r\n#597 Include labels without language tag and concepts without labels in vocabulary\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n#617/#618 Upgrade to simplemma 0.8 and disable unnecessary cache\r\n#595/#611 Autogenerated CLI commands documentation on ReadTheDocs\r\n#612 Add Annif logo to ReadTheDocs sidebar\r\n#608 Multilingual SubjectIndex backed by CSV file\r\n#604 Refactor SubjectSuggestion to store subject_id - not uri, label, notation\r\n\r\n## Maintenance\r\n#607 Remove language suffixes from vocabulary ids in example config\r\n#606 Refactor SubjectSet and Document to store subject IDs instead of URIs and labels\r\n#601/#605 Switch to Poetry for dependency management\r\n#621 Remove curl from Docker image\r\n#622 Remove Poetry cache from Docker image\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n#613 Restore ability to use vocab language different from project language\r\n#619 Allow use of hyphens in vocabulary IDs\r\n#620 Make NN ensemble suggest operations silent"}

The YAKE backend is a wrapper around the [YAKE library](https://github.com/LIAAD/yake), which performs lexical unsupervised keyword extraction. There is no need for training data. See the [YAKE](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/wiki/Backend%3A-YAKE) wiki page for more information. In future Annif releases, it would be possible to extend YAKE support so that it can be used to suggest new terms for a vocabulary (the keywords that are not found in the vocabulary). \r\n\r\nThe SVC backend implements Linear Support Vector Classification. It is well suited for multiclass (but not multilabel) classification, for example classifying documents with the Dewey Decimal Classification or the 20 Newsgroups classification. It requires relatively little training data, and is suitable for classifications of up to around 10,000 classes. See the [SVC](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/wiki/Backend%3A-SVC) wiki page for more information.\r\n\r\nThis release also upgrades many dependencies, which enables all Annif backends to run on Python 3.9 (previously nn_ensemble backend was available only for 3.6-3.8). The Docker image uses now Python 3.8 instead of 3.7. \r\n\r\nNote that nn_ensemble models are not compatible across Python versions: e.g. a model trained on Python 3.7 can be used only on Python 3.7. Training the nn_ensemble models shows a `CustomMaskWarning`, but it is harmless (caused by a [TensorFlow bug](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/49754)) and can be ignored.\r\n\r\nDue to the update of scikit-learn, using TFIDF, MLLM or Omikuji models trained on older Annif versions will show warnings about the `TfidfVectorizer`. To the best of our knowledge, these are harmless and can be ignored. You have to retrain the models to get rid of the warnings.\r\n\r\n This release includes also many minor improvements and bug fixes.\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n#486 New SVC (support vector classification) backend using scikit-learn\r\n#439/#461 YAKE backend\r\n#490/#494 Make --version option show Annif version\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n#488 Add support for ngram setting in omikuji backend\r\n\r\nMaintenance:\r\n#499 Update dependencies v0.53\r\n#487 Upgrade scikit-learn to 0.24.2\r\n#498 Update Dockerfile\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n#484/#495 Show error when training MLLM on empty corpus\r\n#489 Add Codecov Action to GH workflow for uploading reports\r\n#491 Raise NotSupportedException for attempt to train YAKE\r\n#497 Remove execute permissions of some files\r\n"}

It is meant for long full-text documents and like Maui, it needs to be  trained with a relatively small number (hundreds or thousands) of manually indexed documents so that the algorithm can choose the right mix of heuristics that achieves best results on a particular document collection. See [the MLLM Wiki page](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/wiki/Backend%3A-MLLM) for more information.\r\n\r\nNew features include the possibility to configure two project parameters: \r\n- `min_token_length` [can be set in the analyzer parameters](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/wiki/Analyzers); e.g. setting the value to 2 allows the word \"UK\" to pass to a backend, while with the default value (3) the word is filtered out by the analyzer\r\n- `lr` can be set in the [neural-network ensemble](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/wiki/Backend%3A-nn_ensemble) project configuration to define the learning rate.\r\n\r\nThe STWFSA backend has been updated to use a newer version of the [stwfsapy library](https://github.com/zbw/stwfsapy).

Retraining NN ensemble models after updating Annif to this version is recommended, since the quality of results can decrease if old models are used.

New in this release:\r\n\r\n* #270/#272 The CLI command and REST API method `analyze` has been renamed to `suggest` and the CLI command `analyzedir` to `index`. Also some internal data structures were renamed accordingly. The idea is to clarify terminology so that from now one *analyzing* means only the **preprocessing** (e.g. tokenizing and stemming) done by Analyzers, not the whole operation of assigning/suggesting subjects for a document. For some background, see this [post on annif-users](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/annif-users/tHyPIifu7wo/_Uj-SDTSCwAJ)\r\n* #262/#263 Fix some UTF-8 encoding issues, especially on Windows.

This backend is a wrapper for the `oaa`, `ect`, `log_multi` and `multilabel_oaa` multiclass and multilabel classification algorithms implemented by VW. It can use either the document text or the output of other projects (e.g. subjects as determined by another project/backend/model) as the basis for classification.\r\n* #225 / #257 Support for **online learning**, for now implemented only for the new `vw_multi` backend. This includes the new `learn` CLI command as well as a `learn` method in the REST API that can be used to provide additional indexed documents (with subjects/classes) for updating the model.\r\n* #245 The web UI now uses Vue.js instead of jQuery for most dynamic functionality. Credit: @kinow\r\n* #258 The web UI can show detailed error messages returned by the REST API. Credit: @kinow \r\n* #237 / #246 Access levels for projects: you can now define projects as hidden (they will not be shown by the REST API `projects` list but can still be used if you know the project id) or private (not available via REST at all)\r\n* #247 / #248 Fix bug where `eval` command sometimes reported `nan` values\r\n* Some code cleanup and refactoring\r\n\r\nAnnif now also has a DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2578948 - thanks to the [integration between Zenodo and GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/). This DOI represents all versions of Annif and will always resolve to the latest release; additional DOIs are generated by Zenodo for each specific release from now on."}
