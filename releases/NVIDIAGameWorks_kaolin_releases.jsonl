We chose to focus on low-level functions with torch tensors as inputs / outputs, to favor reusability.\r\nHigh-level representation will be added later once the common use cases get more easy to define.\r\n\r\n### Model Zoo\r\nMaintainable and reliable Kaolin means a more compact library. We decided to move the model zoo out of Kaolin, this model zoo will have a dedicate repository, will rely on release of Kaolin, and so will be maintained separately.\r\n\r\n### Batching\r\n\r\nKaolin is now fully batched, by default with a fixed topology, but also (with limited support) representation for heterogenous structures using packed and padded approch, see [documentation](https://kaolin.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.0/modules/kaolin.ops.batch.html) for more details.\r\nWe intend to provide more primitive ops for heterogenous structures.\r\n\r\n### Optimizations\r\n\r\nWe've been mostly focusing on GPU efficiency.\r\nAmong the optimizations, speedups are reported on:\r\n- `kaolin.render.mesh.rasterization.dibr_rasterization(height, width, face_vertice_z, face_vertices_image, face_features, face_normals_z)` (~1.35x faster).\r\n- GraphConv: added a functionality of pre-normalization of the adjacency matrix `kaolin.ops.gcn.GraphConv(node_feat, adj, normalized_adj=False)` (~1.85x faster).\r\n- `kaolin.ops.mesh.check_sign(vertices, faces, points, hash_resolution)`: (~2.75x faster).\r\n- `kaolin.ops.mesh.sample_points(vertices, faces, num_samples, areas)`: added a functionality of pre-computation of faces areas (~1.6x faster)\r\n- `kaolin.ops.conversions.voxelgrids_to_cubic_meshes(voxelgrids, is_trimesh)` (~17x faster on cpu, >10000x faster on gpu)\r\n- `kaolin.ops.voxelgrid.downsample(voxelgrids, scale)` (~6.2x faster on cpu, ~25x faster on gpu)\r\n- `kaolin.ops.voxelgrid.fill(voxelgrids)` (~1.3x faster on cpu)\r\n- `kaolin.ops.voxelgrid.extract_surface(voxelgrids)` (~6.9x faster on cpu, ~37x faster on gpu)\r\n- `kaolin.ops.voxelgrid.extract_odms(voxelgrids)` (~250x faster on cpu, ~1276x faster on gpu)\r\n- `kaolin.ops.voxelgrid.project_odms(odms, voxelgrids, votes)` (~125x faster on cpum ~882x faster on gpu)\r\nWe added a cuda implementation of lorensen's marching cube (used in `kaolin.ops.conversions.voxelgrids_to_trianglemeshes(voxelgrids, iso_value)`)\r\nWe added backpropagation to the triangle distance (used in `kaolin.metrics.trianglemesh.point_to_mesh_distance(pointcloud, vertices, faces)`) and side distance (used in `kaolin.metrics.pointcloud.sided_distance(p1, p2)`, `kaolin.metrics.pointcloud.chamfer_distance(p1, p2, w1, w2)`, `kaolin.metrics.pointcloud.f_score(gt_points, pred_points, radius, eps)`).\r\n\r\n### USD Visualization\r\n\r\nWe now provide importer and exporter to [Universal Scene Description](https://developer.nvidia.com/usd) files, see [the documentation](https://kaolin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/kaolin.io.usd.html) for more information.\r\nYou can open those file using the Omniverse companion app, see Kaolin [Devpage](https://developer.nvidia.com/kaolin).\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nIn alphabetical order:\r\n\r\nWenzheng Chen\r\nSanja Fidler\r\nClement Fuji Tsang\r\nJason Gorski\r\nJean-Francois Lafleche\r\nRev Lebaredian\r\nJianing Li\r\nFrank Shen\r\nMasha Shugrina\r\nGavriel State\r\nJiehan Wang\r\nTommy Xiang"}
