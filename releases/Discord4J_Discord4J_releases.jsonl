We'd like to thank all collaborators, contributors, GitHub sponsors and users working with us towards this release.\r\n\r\nMajor releases allow us to reshape some architectural concepts required to either match Discord evolution as a platform, or new features we want to implement, so they come with migration steps that are detailed in our docs page for [Migration Notes](https://docs.discord4j.com/migrating-from-v3-1-to-v3-2/) and [API changes](https://docs.discord4j.com/whats-new-in-v3-2/#api-changes).\r\n\r\n# What's new in v3.2\r\n\r\n## Discord features\r\n\r\n- Discord API v8, providing richer error messages and mandatory gateway intents\r\n- Changes needed in preparation for threads, to be available in 3.3.0 snapshots\r\n- Reduced queries to Store as user data is provided by Discord in some payloads\r\n- Improved API over recent Discord additions, such as Slash commands initial response handling and `resolved` objects\r\n\r\n## Entity cache\r\n\r\nOur entity cache (named `Store` in D4J) has been reworked and abstracted to enable more flexible implementations that can go beyond a fixed 9-Store scheme. A new default in-memory `Store` is provided and previous implementations are still compatible. Thanks a lot to @Alex1304 for designing and contributing this key feature for future performance improvements.\r\n\r\nDeeper [org.immutables](https://immutables.github.io/) library usage, improving our deserialization process to reduce memory usage.\r\n\r\n## New specs API\r\n\r\nImmutable Specs are now available in Discord4J, enabling more ways of working with API requests through Core module: easier templating, builders and Mono so you can organize your bot code to your liking. This is a very new feature so we expect to get feedback from you to make it better. Older Spec API (based on `Consumer`) is still available for gradual migration.\r\n\r\nCheck our docs page for [Specs](https://docs.discord4j.com/specs) for more details.\r\n\r\n## Better audit log API\r\n\r\nA major release let us fix how to work better with audit logs in D4J, requiring some API changes.\r\n\r\n## Reactor changes\r\n\r\nWe can get the most of Reactor v2020.x changes:\r\n\r\n- Processor usage is deprecated and replaced with `Sinks/EmitResult` API for sending signals programmatically\r\n- Improvements to retry configurations with `RetrySpec`\r\n- Non-blocking DNS resolver in Reactor Netty 1.0.x\r\n\r\n# What's next\r\n\r\n## Threads support\r\n\r\nDiscord4J v3.3 will soon start development to support threads and improve support on stage channels, features that require additional API changes.\r\n\r\n## OAuth2\r\n\r\nWe have a great contribution to support OAuth2 as a module in D4J from @cottoncammy, unfortunately we couldn't add it to v3.2.0 on time without affecting the planned scope. Our goal is to merge it to v3.3.x branch after threads are settled in the D4J API.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDeeper involvement in our Documentation project is planned, providing more how-to guides and sections to quickly implement most common patterns. We'll make use of the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework to organize our articles.\r\n\r\n## Reactor\r\n\r\nWe detected places where improvements can be made after a better understanding of Reactor as a runtime, like a more compact gateway implementation that can work better with back-pressure, mainly for standalone use cases. We would like to explore these in the upcoming releases.\r\n\r\n## Distributed architectures\r\n\r\nAs we remove roadblocks like improving the performance of D4J handling an initial storm of payloads in a distributed bot, we want to spend some time building Store/Connect project implementations that can work more efficiently at large scale.\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n### 3.2.0\r\n- #1005 New methods to work with interactions\r\n    - `getReply`, `editReply`, `deleteReply`, `createFollowup`, `editFollowup`, `deleteFollowup`\r\n    - Prefer `deferReply` and `deferEdit` over `acknowledge`\r\n- #1001 Add support for context menu commands\r\n    - Check the release notes from [3.1.8](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/releases/tag/3.1.8) for upgrade considerations \r\n- #966 Fix nullability annotations in new specs API\r\n- Add MultipartRequest support to message edit and interaction edit route\r\n- Upgrade to Reactor 2020.0.11\r\n- Fix ephemeral messages filtering\r\n- Fix missing guildId in stored VoiceStates\r\n- More details: [Milestone](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/53?closed=1)\r\n\r\n### RC3\r\n- #982 Add PartialMember implementation for message mentions\r\n- #980 Add ApplicationCommandInteraction::getResolved\r\n- #977 Add support for user banner and bannerAccentColor\r\n- #975 Add InteractionValidator for webhook-mode interactions\r\n- deac3ac3 Allow editing interaction messages with a MultipartRequest\r\n- More details: [Milestone](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/51?closed=1)\r\n\r\n### RC2\r\n- #959 Modify channel hierarchy in preparation for threads\r\n- #964 Deserialize interaction message on demand\r\n- More details: [Milestone](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/50?closed=1)\r\n\r\n### RC1\r\n- #799 New default JDK store, under the new entity cache system\r\n- #927 Immutable Specs, a new way of working with API requests\r\n- More details: [Milestone](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/49?closed=1)\r\n\r\n### M4\r\n- #924 Evict stale RequestStreams to reduce memory usage over time \r\n- #898 Make use of UserData when possible\r\n- #902 Custom baseUrl for DiscordWebClient\r\n- #899 Change log improvements #428 #851\r\n- More details: [Milestone](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/43?closed=1)\r\n\r\n### Early milestones\r\n- #874 Improve API for setting a client's status and activity\r\n- #873 Allow passing in member for calculating effective permissions\r\n- #871 Add methods to EntityRetriever and RestClient to make getting self Member easier\r\n- #796 Migrate to Reactor 2020\r\n- #788 New entity cache abstraction\r\n- #785 #787 Upgrade to Discord API v8\r\n- #742 Implement Webhook Execute #547\r\n- More details: [M2](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/38?closed=1) and [M3](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/45?closed=1)\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udc9c Contributors\r\n\r\n@TheNumberOne @qwbarch @Shadorc @Alex1304 @j0rdanit0 @napstr @NovaFox161 @skykatik @HunHage @darichey @YelsewB @Krakenied @Masterzach32 @Azn9 @keltrycroft @quanticc and everyone from the 3.1.x series changes that were included in this release:\r\n\r\n- [3.1.8](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/48?closed=1)\r\n- [3.1.7](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/46?closed=1)\r\n- [3.1.6](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/44?closed=1)\r\n- [3.1.5](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/42?closed=1)\r\n- [3.1.4](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/40?closed=1)\r\n- [3.1.3](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/41?closed=1)\r\n- [3.1.2](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/39?closed=1)\r\n- [3.1.1](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/37?closed=1)", "mentions_count": 17}

It is NOT applied if you specify intents when connecting to the Gateway.\r\n- Learn more about intents [here](https://gist.github.com/advaith1/e69bcc1cdd6d0087322734451f15aa2f) and [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents).\r\n\r\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Behavior change\r\n- Experimental: errors thrown from `GatewayBootstrap::withEventDispatcher` function will now cause a bot to log out. This is a behavior change from previous version on an API marked as Experimental. To retain previous behavior make sure you handle all error sources.\r\n\r\n## \u2b50\ufe0f New features\r\n- Add support for inline replies #789 #809. See known issues above.\r\n- Add support for extracting stickers from Message objects #808\r\n- Add retrying capabilities to HTTP 520 errors #802 #804\r\n- Add `IntentSet.nonPrivileged()` 766e768\r\n- Add methods for obtaining an existing, registered VoiceConnection to associated entities #783\r\n- Add support for ReactiveEventAdapter through `GatewayDiscordClient::on` and `EventDispatcher::on`, allowing a more listener-like approach to event subscription a5d6153\r\n- Update Integration support #794\r\n- Add VoiceStateUpdateEvent functions to determine the kind of event #770\r\n- Allow enabling unpooled inbound allocation method. This can help debugging leak issues eae077b\r\n- Add overload to `Guild::requestMembers` by user ID set 4059ded\r\n- Reject voice connections if missing voice states intent 7d2dbeb\r\n- Add timeout to incompatible full member list requests b36af22\r\n- Deprecate PrivateChannelCreateEvent #786\r\n- Add subscriber context to `GatewayDiscordClient::on(Class, Function)` 14dab2c\r\n- Forward errors from `withEventDispatcher` to terminate Gateway connections 03bee01\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udc1e Bug fixes\r\n- Fix voice resume, now it's working as expected #778\r\n- Fix DefaultVoiceConnectionFactory not releasing resources on cancel/error 62e2526\r\n- Fix NPE when creating webhook on TextChannel without avatar image #777\r\n- Migrate deprecated retryWhen in GatewayBootstrap, this will make D4J compatible with Reactor 3.4+ or Spring Boot 2.4+ 8203a98\r\n- Add integration payloads to the ignored types, avoiding the annoying JSON error messages 56a37c4\r\n- Fix ValueInstantiationException when GuildCreateEvent contains unavailable guild #801\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udcd4 Documentation\r\n- Clarify availability of Message::getGuildId #762\r\n- Update Guild documentation #792\r\n- Update Community Guild documentation #793\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udd28 Dependency upgrades\r\n- Reactor Dysprosium-SR14, including reactor-core [3.3.11](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/releases/tag/v3.3.11.RELEASE) and reactor-netty [0.9.14](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty/releases/tag/v0.9.14.RELEASE)\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udc9c Contributors\r\nThanks to our contributors that helped us with PRs and ideas for this release: @cameronprater @Shadorc \r\n"}

Our [What's new in v3.1](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/wiki/What's-new-in-v3.1) article also summarizes most important changes. Don't forget to check the [wiki](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/wiki) for new 3.1 related articles.\r\n\r\n# Future work\r\n\r\nDiscord4J is an evolving platform aiming to cover the needs of many bot configurations and therefore a lot of challenges come next: making sure we can expand on our [Stores](https://github.com/Discord4J/Stores) project with efficient and scalable caching, our [Connect](https://github.com/Discord4J/connect) project for distributed Bot architectures and a [range](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/35) improvements are on the radar.\r\n\r\nWe also want to improve documentation and code examples on our core methods so we'll soon work on a [new way](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/issues/721) to publish our documentation so collaborating with us will be made simpler.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these goals your feedback is crucial, so participating in our Discord, asking for help, sharing your projects and ideas are always welcome! Together we can turn them into new features and knowledge to help all Discord4J users.\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\nClosed milestones towards this release: [M1](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/20?closed=1), [M2](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/29?closed=1), [RC1](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/33?closed=1) and all changes from RC2, RC3 and RC4 [here](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/milestone/18?closed=1).\r\n\r\nChanges in 3.0.x are in most cases forward-ported to 3.1 so they are also included: [3.0.6](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/releases/tag/3.0.6), [3.0.7](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/releases/tag/3.0.7), [3.0.8](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/releases/tag/3.0.8), [3.0.9](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/releases/tag/3.0.9), [3.0.10](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/releases/tag/3.0.10), [3.0.11](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/releases/tag/3.0.11), [3.0.12](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/releases/tag/3.0.12), [3.0.13](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/releases/tag/3.0.13), [3.0.14](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/releases/tag/3.0.14) and [3.0.15](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/releases/tag/3.0.15).\r\n\r\nThis list is not exhaustive so if you discover something missing or need help while migrating, please let us know!\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\ude80 Architectural changes\r\n- New API to build clients: `DiscordClient` can create `GatewayDiscordClient` that manages a *shard group*\r\n- A *shard group* now shares event dispatching and entity caching\r\n- DiscordClient is capable of working with the REST API independently from Gateway operations\r\n- Consequently, REST entities were created to interact with API objects without preemptive HTTP requests\r\n- Created new project to model Discord domain objects: [discord-json](https://github.com/Discord4J/discord-json)\r\n\r\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Update considerations\r\n- Remove ShardingClientBuilder, please follow our migration guide to use the new API\r\n- Make DiscordClientBuilder constructor no longer publicly visible\r\n- Move Snowflake to common module\r\n- Move Permission, PermissionSet and Image to rest module\r\n- Change return type of Message#getContent to String\r\n- Change return type of ClientException#getErrorResponse (#570)\r\n- Change return type of GatewayClient#getResponseTime (#574)\r\n- Remove command module\r\n- Refactor Presence/Activity classes (dec1935c)\r\n- Remove revoked Invite field (#569)\r\n- Move Router customization to DiscordClientBuilder (f16e3861)\r\n- Some loggers were refactored or moved (19e39f7a)\r\n- EventDispatcher is now an interface and can be highly customized\r\n- Disable debug mode by default due to performance costs.

Moving forward, the method makes most sense if it returns a handle for the underlying gateway connections\r\n- Specs won't be called until the sequence they belong is subscribed to (#646)\r\n\r\n## \u2b50\ufe0f New features and enhancements\r\n- Add Gateway intents support (#609, #713, #718, fc6dc23c)\r\n- New default event dispatcher that can replay startup events to late subscribers (89996739)\r\n- Add event dispatcher subscription lifecycle logging (b2d5e63f)\r\n- Add EntityRetriever abstraction for core entity fetching (#641)\r\n- Improve bulkDelete implementation and documentation (#745) \r\n- Add ReactorResources to customize Reactor threading model and other properties (with #640 enhancement)\r\n- New approach to rate limiting across the board (buckets, global and gateway)\r\n- Use reactive return types in GlobalRateLimiter (#568)\r\n- Permit raw RGB values in EmbedCreateSpec#setColor (#613)\r\n- Replace java.awt.color with custom Color class (#705, #710)\r\n- Add allowed mentions to control sent message pings (#673)\r\n- Switch to immutable objects for our data layer using discord-json project (#522)\r\n- Add loggers to track raw JSON payloads and HTTP messages.

While we do not think development is finished, it never will be, we are highly confident and proud of the current product and believe it is ready for general consumption.\r\n\r\nWhy was v2 phased out? [Many reasons](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/wiki/Migration-Guide#what-is-wrong-with-v2), but the TL;DR is it was old and fell into an irrecoverable decay. v3 has been built with a future in mind, a future in asynchronous and reactive modern Java, with an API built on consistency and modularity to allow more flexible changes into the future.\r\n\r\nIf you are a v2 user, check out our [Migration Guide](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/wiki/Migration-Guide). Additionally, you are always welcome to ask questions in the `#d4j-v3-help` channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NxGAeCY).\r\n\r\nIf you are a new user, welcome! Discord4J provides a lot to offer for your bot development experience. We have adjusted our library to accommodate imperative and reactive paradigms to allow programmers of many skill levels to participate with our library. Check out the [Music Bot Tutorial](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/wiki/Music-Bot-Tutorial) for an in-depth introduction to the library and programming your first bot with Discord4J.\r\n\r\nWe want thank all our users for waiting and testing v3 during these long 2 years. On behalf of the Discord4J development team, we would especially like to thank our big bot users, mainly @Shadorc for sticking with us and helping us develop and test with his huge bot. We wouldn't be nearly as far or as battle tested without him. And an additional thank you to all our testers for providing some API feedback, submitting issues, and pull requests and are hoping for more into the future.\r\n\r\n3.0.0 is an exciting new era for Discord4J and we are happy for all of you to be a part of it."}

This is a breaking change as it has removed and added various methods. The rework aims to better manipulate your bot's presence and allow a lot more customization than previously allocated with far fewer methods.\r\n* All instances of `LocalDateTime` have been converted to `Instant` to better represent the actual data that is being manipulated and to mitigate various confusion on the usage of such methods. This is also a breaking change.\r\n* Fixed ordering of `MessageHistory#getMessageHistory` when all the messages were in the cache\r\n* Fixed NPE if JARs did not have a Manifest for modules\r\n* Fixed NPE when automatically enabling modules\r\n* ReadyEvent wait time now scales linearly with guild count\r\n* Fixed numerous bugs related to reactions\r\n* Fixed NPEs and UOEs for MessageUpdateEvents\r\n* Fixed NPEs on Reaction Add/Remove Events\r\n* Fixed `IGuild#getOwner` occasionally returning `null`\r\n* Increased concurrency for `DispatchHandler`\r\n* Fixed NFEs when parsing certain channel IDs\r\n* Changed `RequestBuffer.request(IVoidRequest)` to be more fluent to use\r\n\r\n### \\- Removed\r\n* Anything removed is related to previously mentioned changes."}

Our entire websocket backend was rewritten by the lovely @GrandPanda, and shouldn't affect you too heavily. Two new co-developers also joined the team, @GrandPanda and @chrislo27.\n\n## Notable Changes\n- The entire websocket (including voice) was _completely_ rewritten ground-up, and there was a lot of ground.\n  - This should have much better **reconnects** and **sharding**.\n  - Many, **many** thanks to @GrandPanda for taking on this ordeal.\n- Sharding has been re-implemented. No more [_baby I'm a broken man, I'm just a shattering storm_](https://youtu.be/41ePKz5G2dI?t=9s).\n  - An `IDiscordClient` is now basically a \"shard holder\" for `IShards`. This should not affect your existing code, unless you were using the old sharding system. Many `changeX` methods are now also available on `IShard` for individual tweaking.\n- The module loader shouldn't implode with nested classes. @robot-rover has added struts to stop it from doing that.\n- Retrieval of custom server emoji support added. Now you can emoji it up :joy: :joy: :joy: :100: :rocket: :boom: \n  - `MessageTokenizer` also has support for tokenizing this.\n- Reactions have been added. I cannot react to this because I spent all my energy writing this feature. :weary: \n  - Support for getting, adding, removing (and other users'), and polling the users that reacted.\n- File uploads shouldn't scream when you have no content. We have applied duct tape to its mouth.\n- `IApplication` has suffered collateral damage during the websocket rewrite.\n- `VerificationLevel` has been added by @ThatRedheadMC. Now you can securely secure security on your public Discord servers.\n- Webhook support and a refactoring of embeds has been added by @UnderMyBrella.\n- Embed sending support (rich text) has been added for messages by @chrislo27.\n  - Use the new `EmbedBuilder` to build an `EmbedObject` to pass through `sendMessage(content, embed, tts)`.\n  - `IChannel#sendFile` will not have this because it uses form-data.\n\n## Changelog\n\n### \\+ Additions\n- `IEmoji` handle\n- New sharding and reconnects\n- `IReaction` handle\n  - Add/remove methods are in `IMessage`\n  - Thanks to @theIglooo for the JSON examples and endpoints\n  - `IMessage#removeAllReactions`\n- Adds `IGuild#getUsersByRole` (@Masterzach32)\n- Adds `IGuild#getConnectedVoiceChannel` (@Masterzach32)\n- Incomplete request counts are available (@nija123098)\n- `IMessage` can tell the difference between an everyone and here mention\n- `IMessage` has getFormattedMessage to turn mentions into usernames with the at-sign\n- `IMessage` has pin/unpin methods (previously only availble on `IChannel`)\n- `VerificationLevel` handle by @ThatRedheadMC\n- `IWebhook` handle + others by @UnderMyBrella\n- `EmbedBuilder` added\n  - `IMessage#sendMessage` modified to allow for `EmbedObjects` (built with an `EmbedBuilder`)\n- `EventDispatcher#unregisterListener(Class)` implemented correctly\n\n### \\* Changes\n- Entire websocket rewritten\n  - Part of rewrite: #150 by @ArsenArsen \n- Modules should load more effectively, starting with the parent class\n- `MessageTokenizer` can tokenize everyone and here mentions, along with custom emojis\n- File upload with no content fixed\n- Dependencies updated\n- Unknown enum constants will be handled effectively by @theIglooo \n- `IEmbedded` replaced with `IEmbed` (same functionality)\n- Module improvements by @robot-rover (#144)\n- Incomplete request count tracking by @nija123098 (#134)\n- AudioPlayer constructor fix by @BloodShura (#151)\n- Adds private check to MessageList#bulkDelete and adds IUser#getPermissionsForGuild by @nija123098 (#155)\n- Fix Opus natives by @DV8FromTheWorld\n- `MissingPermissionsException` now has an exposed missing permissions `EnumSet` by @oopsjpeg \n- Fix ConcurrentModificationException some users were having by @Masterzach32 (#180)\n\n### \\- Deletions\n- All user support removed\n- Removed `IApplication`\n"}

It has also undergone major refactoring, so you will find a few things marked as deprecated. Notable changes to developers using this api:\n- DiscordClient is no longer a singleton instance, meaning that you could use multiple users in one application. In order to create a new instance use the new `ClientBuilder` class. Note, when creating an instance, Discord4J will warn you about any unsupported or deprecated features.\n- The event dispatcher system is less stupid now, you could use `IListener` and `@EventSubscriber` interchangeably without messing with the event dispatcher instance.\n- Releases are a thing now. You could download the dev version from my CI Server as well as using maven. For more information, look at the project's README.\n- Shaded jars! No longer do you need to worry about dependency management with Discord4J\n\nIn the future I plan on adding a few unique features, but only after the implementation of the discord api is complete enough.\n"}
