Previously, if you had the following, it would not identify `s3:GetObject` as being allowed, because it saw an `Allow` and a `Deny` and did not take into consideration the `Condition`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\r\n  \"Statement\": [\r\n    {\r\n        \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\r\n        \"Action\": \"s3:GetObject\",\r\n        \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::secretbucket/*\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"Effect\": \"Deny\",\r\n        \"Action\": \"s3:GetObject\",\r\n        \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::secretbucket/*\",\r\n        \"Condition\": {\r\n            \"BoolIfExists\": {\r\n                \"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": \"false\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the logic identifies `s3:GetObject` as being allowed, because it only counts a `Deny` against the `Allow` if the `Deny` has no `Condition`.  This should better handle possible tricks someone might do to get around a custom auditor someone might write (for example, the sensitive bucket auditor in the docs would have been tricked by this previously).\r\n\r\nThe unit tests should also be more robust, and a bug was fixed with how Bool's are checked to ensure they are being matched against true and false values."}
