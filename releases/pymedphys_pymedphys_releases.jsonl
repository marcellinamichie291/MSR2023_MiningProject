This release coincides\r\n  with the culmination of Jake's PhD and this version will be the one\r\n  referenced within his dissertation. It has been brilliant to see both Jake\r\n  and his project grow to be what it is today. Thank you Jake \ud83d\ude0a.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* The configuration for the TRF CLI now utilises the centralised `config.toml`\r\n  file instead of the prior `CSV` files.\r\n\r\n### New features and enhancements\r\n\r\n* A range of application have been added to and improved on within the\r\n  PyMedPhys GUI.\r\n  * A Daily WLutz application was added which utilises the air cavity within\r\n    an iso-cube, combined with morning run-up beams (as arcs) to record the\r\n    beam position at every gantry angle for each photon beam each morning.\r\n  * A range of configuration improvements, making more applications more widely\r\n    able to be utilised. Of particular note are Jake's transfer check and\r\n    weekly check applications which were written as a part of his PhD.\r\n  * A QCL investigator tool, allowing one to produce plots and break downs\r\n    of numbers of QCLs broken down either by QCL type, or the user who\r\n    completed them.\r\n  * An extend ct application was added providing the means to duplicate slices\r\n    superiorly and inferiorly.\r\n  * An application for the viewing of back-end iView jpg images.\r\n  * An application for tweaking the WLutz algorithm options from iView back-end\r\n    jpg images.\r\n  * A range of fixes and improvements within the WLutz Arc and the MetersetMap\r\n    applications.\r\n* The docs are now distributed with the PyMedPhys package. These are accessible\r\n  by opening `http://localhost:8501/docs/index.html` after running\r\n  `pymedphys gui`. In the future it is intended to make this link more\r\n  accessible.\r\n* A range of error messaging has been improved. Of particular benefit to new\r\n  users is the error message that occurs when a dependency is missing.\r\n* The ball-bearing finding component of the WLutz algorithm was tweaked to\r\n  be able to also support the finding of air-cavities within an iso-cube.\r\n* The testing suite around Mosaiq was built upon and extended across the\r\n  breadth of PyMedPhys.\r\n* Fixed a bug which was making `pymedphys.Delivery.from_mosaiq` non functional.\r\n* Fixed a bug where some TRF files where not able to be decoded. Thank you\r\n  LipTeck for [the bug report](https://pymedphys.discourse.group/t/request-to-use-file-name-for-missing-field-id-and-field-name-in-trf/156/6).\r\n* The `pymedphys.trf.identify` interface was moved out of beta. See the\r\n  documentation for this newly stable API over at <https://docs.pymedphys.com/lib/ref/trf.html>.\r\n* Improved the robustness of the internal `extend ct` routines.\r\n* **[Contributor facing only]** created `pymedphys dev mssql` which boots up\r\n  a docker image of the Developer edition of Microsoft SQL. This is for\r\n  utilisation by the Mosaiq testing suite.\r\n* **[Contributor facing only]** made `pymedphys dev tests --cypress`\r\n  automatically include the options `-v` and `-s` for displaying the `cypress`\r\n  printouts during testing as well as `--reruns 5` so that the test\r\n  automatically reruns on failure in alignment with the CI procedure."}

Thank you Derek! \ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf88 \ud83e\udd73.\r\n* [Matt Jennings](https://github.com/Matthew-Jennings) has rejoined the team,\r\n  picking up his previous hat of Maintainer, great to have you back Matt \ud83d\ude0a.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* The modules `pymedphys.electronfactors` and `pymedphys.wlutz` were removed\r\n  from the public API.\r\n  * There did not appear to be any usage of these modules outside of Cancer\r\n    Care Associates.\r\n  * The electron factors module can be re-exposed upon request.\r\n  * The Winston Lutz module is undergoing a significant re-work and will be\r\n    re-exposed in its new form once complete.\r\n* There have been a range of changes to the previously undocumented Mosaiq\r\n  database connection and execution API.\r\n  * `pymedphys.mosaiq.connect` now returns a `Connection` object instead of a\r\n    `Cursor` object. This was so as to align with PEP0249. See <https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/pull/1352>.\r\n  * All instances where previously the argument name within a function or\r\n    method was `cursor` have been changed to `connection`.\r\n  * Previously a server and port could be provided to `pymedphys.mosaiq.connect`\r\n    by passing it as a colon separated string, for example `\"localhost:1234\"`.\r\n    This is no longer the case. Now, hostname and port need to be provided\r\n    separately. There are also three extra arguments, `alias`, `username`, and\r\n    `password`. See either the docs <https://docs.pymedphys.com/lib/ref/mosaiq.html>\r\n    or the docstring for more details <https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/blob/a124bc56fb576456cc6eec44a711ebd478a995f3/lib/pymedphys/_mosaiq/api.py#L33-L79>.\r\n  * Removed `pymedphys.mosaiq.qcls`.\r\n* **[Contributor facing only]** replaced `pymedphys dev tests --pylint` with\r\n  `pymedphys dev lint`.\r\n\r\n### New features and enhancements\r\n\r\n* Added CLI argument for setting the hostname on the DICOM listen server. For\r\n  example `pymedphys dicom listen 7779 --host 127.0.0.1`.\r\n* Added DICOM send functionality to DICOM connect module and made it available on the CLI. For example `pymedphys dicom send 127.0.0.1 7779 path\\to\\dicom\\*.dcm`\r\n* A range of application changes and improvements. The PyMedPhys app can be\r\n  accessed by running `pymedphys gui`.\r\n* **[Streamlit users only]** A CLI command `pymedphys streamlit run` was added\r\n  to facilitate utilising the custom PyMedPhys patches on the streamlit server\r\n  for arbitrary streamlit apps. See <https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/issues/1422>.\r\n* **[Contributor facing only]** Added the following contributor CLI tools/options:\r\n  * `pymedphys dev tests --mosaiqdb`, to load up the tests that depend on having\r\n    a Microsoft SQL server running. Thanks to [Derek Lane](https://github.com/dg1an3)\r\n    for all of his work building the Mosaiq CI workflow and the first set of\r\n    Mosaiq tests.\r\n  * `pymedphys dev doctests`, run doctests.\r\n  * `pymedphys dev imports`, verify optional import logic by creating a clean\r\n    Python install and attempting to import all modules.\r\n  * `pymedphys dev lint`, run pylint.\r\n  * `pymedphys dev cypress`, load up Cypress for interactively writing and\r\n    running the end-to-end tests.\r\n\r\n### Misc changes\r\n\r\n* Significant work was undergone to improve the documentation layout. Thanks to\r\n  [Matt Jennings](https://github.com/Matthew-Jennings) for all his work here.\r\n* How Mosaiq username and passwords are saved has been updated. This will\r\n  result in these credentials being requested once more."}

goal for this group is to build a community where we can discuss and\r\n  collaborate around all things related to PyMedPhys.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* **Developer facing only**: The `--live` parameter within `pymedphys dev docs`\r\n  has been removed.\r\n\r\n### New features and enhancements\r\n\r\n* `pymedphys dicom listen` stores incoming DICOM objects in a directory\r\n  hierarchy: PatientID/Study Instance UID/Series Instance UID aligning with the\r\n  DICOM Q/R hierarchy, and more suitable for use with tools like dicompyler and\r\n  OnkoDICOM. See PR [#1208](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/pull/1208)\r\n  for more details.\r\n\r\n```{note}\r\nThis `pymedphys dicom listen` adjustment changes where a 3rd party or in-house\r\nprogram would expect to find the DICOM data on the file system compared to the\r\nprevious release.\r\n\r\nPlease raise an issue on GitHub\r\n<https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/issues/new> if you believe changes like\r\nthis in the future should be considered a breaking change.\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Documentation now uses the new [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) tool\r\n  from the [Executable Book Project](https://executablebooks.org/). Among other\r\n  things this has enabled:\r\n  * Live running of notebook documentation using\r\n    [Thebe](https://thebelab.readthedocs.io/)\r\n  * Discourse commenting now available directly within the hosted documentation\r\n  * The ability to utilise the expanded\r\n    [MyST](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html) Documentation formatting.\r\n* Increased docstring coverage of public functions\r\n* Installation on MacOS (Intel) has been simplified and is now the same as for\r\n  other platforms, thanks to [@termim](https://github.com/termim) who has taken\r\n  on the mantle of maintaining `pymssql`. See PR\r\n  [pymssql#677](https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/677) for more details.\r\n* Streamlit development now supports reloading during development across the\r\n  whole PyMedPhys library. See PR\r\n  [#1202](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/pull/1202) for more details.\r\n* A pre-release binary has been built and CI infrastructure around it has begun\r\n  being built. Watch this space for a future release where it will be\r\n  officially distributed. See PR\r\n  [#1192](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/pull/1192) for more details.\r\n* Create a [`__main__.py`](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/blob/56667dc84a532179f37a486e61663736c0f43eae/lib/pymedphys/__main__.py#L1-L19)\r\n  so that the PyMedPhys CLI can be called using `python -m pymedphys`.\r\n  * This is to support running the GUI and the tests within the binary.\r\n* Created a `requirements-user.txt`, this will allow users to install PyMedPhys\r\n  from the repo while using the exact dependencies that are being tested within\r\n  the CI. See PR [#1266](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/pull/1266) for\r\n  more details.\r\n* `pymedphys dev propagate` had the `--copies` and `--pyproject` flags added.\r\n  This allows for subsections of propagate to be undergone instead of the whole\r\n  procedure.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* CLI initialisation was delayed by unused tensorflow imports\r\n* Pseudonymisation of Decimal String (e.g. Patient Weight) was failing. See\r\n  [#1244](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/pull/1244) for more details.\r\n* Pseudonymisation of Date, Time or DateTime elements with embedded UTC offsets\r\n  would fail.\r\n* Improved Mosaiq username and password login. Thank you\r\n  [@nickmenzies](https://github.com/nickmenzies) for reporting. See PR\r\n  [#1199](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/pull/1199) for more details.\r\n* `pymedphys gui` will use the Python used to run the CLI to boot streamlit as\r\n  opposed to the streamlit able to be found on the user's PATH. See\r\n  [pymedphys/_gui.py](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/blob/56667dc84a532179f37a486e61663736c0f43eae/lib/pymedphys/_gui.py#L48-L56) for\r\n  more details. This is to support booting the GUI within the binary.\r\n* `dateutil` dependency was removed for compatibility reasons with Streamlit's\r\n  cache. This tool was replaced with an equivalent tool within `pandas`. See\r\n  [pymedphys/_trf/manage/identify.py](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/blob/56667dc84a532179f37a486e61663736c0f43eae/lib/pymedphys/_trf/manage/identify.py#L31-L66)\r\n  for more details.\r\n* A range of fixes for the testing infrastructure for the case where the\r\n  pymedphys CLI isn't on the user's path.\r\n  * This was to support testing within the binary infrastructure.\r\n\r\n### Library structure changes\r\n\r\n* All GUI tools that are labelled experimental are now appropriately located\r\n  within the experimental part of the library."}

Thank you Stuart! You\r\n  have been a massive help and encouragement.\r\n* Created an online PyMedPhys GUI. It is accessible from\r\n  <https://app.pymedphys.com>. This is in its early stages and most parts of\r\n  the online GUI are not optimised for use in this fashion.\r\n  * Of note, its main purpose is to demonstrate the GUI functionality. If you\r\n    wish to begin using this GUI in your centre install PyMedPhys on your local\r\n    machine and then start it by calling `pymedphys gui` within a\r\n    terminal/command prompt.\r\n  * The online demo GUI should not have sensitive information submitted to it.\r\n* [@matthewdeancooper](https://github.com/matthewdeancooper) uploaded his\r\n  Masters thesis on deep learning auto-segmentation to\r\n  [the docs](https://docs.pymedphys.com/background/autocontouring.html#details).\r\n* PyMedPhys was featured in a talk at the ACPSEM 2020 Summer School. Both the\r\n  [video](https://simonbiggs.net/acpsem-summer-school-2020-video) and\r\n  [slides](https://simonbiggs.net/acpsem-summer-school-2020-slides) are\r\n  available online.\r\n\r\n### \"Stable\" API changes\r\n\r\n(Won't truly be stable until after a 1.0.0 release)\r\n\r\n#### Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* The parameter `fraction_number` within `pymedphys.Delivery.from_dicom` and\r\n  `pymedphys.Delivery.to_dicom` has been changed to `fraction_group_number`.\r\n* The name of the first argument to `pymedphys.Delivery.from_dicom` has been\r\n  changed from `dicom_dataset` to `rtplan`. It now also accepts either a\r\n  `pydicom.Dataset` or a filepath.\r\n* A range of files utilised by `pymedphys.data_path` and related functions\r\n  that contained the words \"mudensity\", \"mu-density\", or \"mu_density\" have\r\n  been replaced with \"metersetmap\".\r\n* The exceptions that `pymedphys.Delivery.from_mosaiq` raises when either\r\n  no entry in Mosaiq is found (`NoMosaiqEntries`) or multiple entries are found\r\n  (`MultipleMosaiqEntries`) now both inherit from `ValueError` instead of the\r\n  base `Exception` class.\r\n\r\n#### Deprecations\r\n\r\n* All instances of `mudensity` have been replaced with `metersetmap`. The\r\n  `mudensity` API is still currently available, but it will be removed in a\r\n  future release.\r\n* `pymedphys.Delivery.from_logfile` has been renamed as\r\n  `pymedphys.Delivery.from_trf`. The previous name is still temporarily\r\n  available but it will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n\r\n* Added CLI `pymedphys dicom listen` [#1161](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/pull/1161).\r\n  This begins a DICOM listener which will store the DICOM files sent to it to\r\n  disk. It accepts the arguments `--port`, `--aetitle`, and\r\n  `--storage_directory`. Thanks [@pchlap](https://github.com/pchlap)!\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Sometimes a range of DICOM API calls would require the downloading of a\r\n  baseline DICOM dictionary. This is now distributed with the library.\r\n\r\n### GUI changes\r\n\r\n#### Logistics changes\r\n\r\n* `pymedphys gui` now boots up a multi application index. This index breaks\r\n  applications up into five categories, mature, maturing, raw, beta, and\r\n  experimental.\r\n\r\n#### Pseudonymise\r\n\r\n* A new pseudonymise application has been created. This allows users to drag\r\n  and drop DICOM files into the GUI and then download the resulting DICOM file\r\n  in its pseudonymised form. Thanks\r\n  [@sjswerdloff](https://github.com/sjswerdloff)!\r\n\r\n#### MetersetMap\r\n\r\n##### New Features\r\n\r\n* The MetersetMap comparison application (which used to be MU density) is now\r\n  able to work with a bare bones configuration file which can be used by just\r\n  dragging and dropping TRF and DICOM files for comparison. See\r\n  [#1117](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/pull/1117#issue-513765705)\r\n  for details of the configuration file needed.\r\n* Path configuration now supports expansion of `~` to the users home directory.\r\n\r\n##### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* In some cases a patient having a middle name would cause the DICOM file\r\n  upload method to crash. Thanks [@mchamberland](https://github.com/mchamberland)\r\n  for reporting in [#1137](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/issues/1137)\r\n  and thanks [@sjswerdloff](https://github.com/sjswerdloff) for the prompt fix\r\n  in [#1144](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/pull/1144)!\r\n\r\n#### Experimental applications\r\n\r\n* A new \"anonymise monaco\" application has been exposed. This allows the\r\n  back-end Monaco filesystem to be anonymised in such a way that Monaco can\r\n  still open and work with the contents.\r\n* A new \"dashboard\" application has been exposed. This connects to multiple\r\n  Mosaiq sites and displays the QCLs across each site.\r\n* A new \"electrons\" application has been exposed. This reads Monaco back-end\r\n  files, extract the electron insert shape and then predicts the corresponding\r\n  insert output factor.\r\n* A new \"iviewdb\" application has been exposed. This allows for exploration of\r\n  the iView database.\r\n* Work has begun on a new Winston Lutz Arc GUI.\r\n\r\n### Configuration changes\r\n\r\n#### New keys\r\n\r\n* `~/.pymedphys/config.toml` should now include a `version = 1` entry. This\r\n  is to support undergoing breaking changes within `config.toml` but allowing\r\n  PyMedPhys to still read in old configuration files without issue.\r\n* For use within the up-coming Winston-Lutz Arc GUI a new key\r\n  `site.export-directories.iviewdb` has been created.\r\n\r\n### Beta API changes\r\n\r\n* Nil\r\n\r\n### Experimental API changes\r\n\r\n#### Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Removed `pymedphys experimental gui`.\r\n\r\n#### New Features\r\n\r\n* Within `pymedphys.experimental.pseudonymisation` both `pseudonymise` and\r\n  `is_valid_strategy_for_keywords` were added. `pseudonymise` provides\r\n  a convenient simple API for pseudonymisation.

Credit to [@sjswerdloff](https://github.com/sjswerdloff)\r\n  for all his work here.\r\n\r\n### Developer facing API changes\r\n\r\n* The pymedphys library directory has moved to `lib/pymedphys`.\r\n  After this move you will need to rerun `poetry install -E dev`\r\n* The development branch of pymedphys has moved from [master](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/tree/master)\r\n  to [main](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/tree/main)\r\n* Documentation is now stored within the library, moving from `docs` to\r\n  `lib/pymedphys/docs`\r\n* Docs can now be built, viewed, and updated with hot-reloading by running\r\n  `poetry run pymedphys dev docs --live`.\r\n* The output directory for the docs building can now be controlled by passing\r\n  an `--output` flag to `pymedphys dev docs`.\r\n* A new CLI utility that propagates a range of files that depend upon each\r\n  other files within the repo are \"propagated\" by calling\r\n  `poetry run pymedphys dev propagate`. The files created/updated by this\r\n  command are `lib/pymedphys/_version.py`, `requirements.txt` and\r\n  `requirements-dev.txt`, `lib/pymedphys/.pylintrc`,\r\n  `lib/pymedphys/docs/README.rst`, `lib/pymedphys/docs/CHANGELOG.md`, and the\r\n  'extras' field within `pyproject.toml`.\r\n* `pymedphys dev tests` includes simplified flags. `--run-only-slow` can\r\n  be undergone with `--slow`, `--run-only-yarn` with `--cypress`,\r\n  `--run-only-pydicom` with `--pydicom`, and `--run-only-pylinac` with\r\n  `--pylinac`.\r\n* Within cypress end to end testing the custom `cy.start` command now has a\r\n  parameter `app` which refers to the URL app key of the application to be\r\n  tested `http://localhost:8501/?app=${app}`."}

These\r\n  are `replacement_strategy` and `identifying_keywords`. This was designed to\r\n  support alternative anonymisation methods. The API to the anonymise function\r\n  is being flagged for a rework and simplification for which a breaking change\r\n  is likely to occur in the near future.\r\n* Added ability to configure logging via `config.toml`.\r\n\r\n#### Data file changes\r\n\r\nRefers to the data files accessible via `pymedphys.data_path`,\r\n`pymedphys.zip_data_paths`, and `pymedphys.zenodo_data_paths`.\r\n\r\n* The data file `pinnacle_test_data_no_image.zip` was removed and its contents\r\n  were moved into `pinnacle_test_data.zip`.\r\n* Data files `treatment-record-anonymisation.zip`, `negative-mu-density.trf`,\r\n  and `trf-references-and-baselines.zip` were added.\r\n\r\n### Beta API changes\r\n\r\nNil\r\n\r\n### Experimental API changes\r\n\r\n#### New Features\r\n\r\n* Added pseudonymisation as an experimental extension of anonymise.\r\n  * This API is undergoing refinement, however in its current form it is\r\n    accessible via\r\n    `pymedphys.experimental.pseudonymisation.pseudonymisation_dispatch`\r\n    and `pymedphys.experimental.pseudonymisation.get_default_pseudonymisation_keywords`.\r\n    These are designed to be passed to the new keywords `replacement_strategy`\r\n    and `identifying_keywords` within `pymedphys.dicom.anonymise`.\r\n  * The pseudonymisation strategy uses SHA3_256 hashing for text and UIDs, date\r\n    shifting for dates, and jittering for Age. The intent is to enable sets of\r\n    data that are correlated to remain correlated, and to prevent uncorrelated\r\n    patient/study/series from clashing.\r\n* Added experimental pseudonymisation CLI. Callable via\r\n  `pymedphys experimental dicom anonymise --pseudo path/to/dicom.dcm`\r\n\r\n* Added `pymedphys experimental gui`. This is a testing ground for new GUIs\r\n  that are intended to appear within `pymedphys gui` in the future. The GUIs\r\n  exposed under this experimental scope are minimally tested.\r\n  * At this point in time, the new GUIs include a GUI index, an electron\r\n    insert factor prediction tool, and a Monaco anonymisation tool.\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Pinnacle Export Tool now allows for the trial to be set using the CLI.\r\n  See issue [#973](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/issues/973)\r\n  and pull request [#995](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/pull/995) for\r\n  more details.\r\n* Fixed bug where the dose grid in the Pinnacle Export Tool was only correct\r\n  when patients were in HFS. See\r\n  [#929](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/pull/929) for more details."}

This functionality\r\n  used to be undergone within the `pymedphys icom archive` CLI, but this\r\n  functionality has now been merged into the listener. [`listener.py#L79`](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/blob/d40a5ed238b2035bac00da1cb623c7f496ed0950/pymedphys/_icom/listener.py#L79)\r\n* Should an error occur within `pymedphys icom listener` CLI it will now pause\r\n  for 15 minutes and then reattempt a connection.\r\n* Add in extra sanity checks within the iCOM patient indexing tooling.\r\n* Added a `--debug` and `--verbose` flag to the PyMedPhys CLI which allows\r\n  users to set the logging level. These logging levels are currently only\r\n  utilised within the `pymedphys icom listen` CLI. [`cli/main.py#L51-L70`](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/blob/9c7c7e3c2d7fb49d30b418dca2fa28e6982ff97e/pymedphys/cli/main.py#L51-L70)\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Reduced the buffer size of the iCOM listener. [`listener.py#L9`](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/blob/d40a5ed238b2035bac00da1cb623c7f496ed0950/pymedphys/_icom/listener.py#L9)\r\n* If either the listener is turned off and then on again, or it is interrupted\r\n  the next time an iCOM stream socket is opened the Linac appears to send a\r\n  larger batch containing prior irradiations. The listener code was adjusted\r\n  to handle these extra bursts. [`listener.py#L57-L83`](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/blob/d40a5ed238b2035bac00da1cb623c7f496ed0950/pymedphys/_icom/listener.py#L57-L83)\r\n* Made PyMedPhys GUI skip name formatting attempt if the original patient name\r\n  format was not as expected.

GUI at this stage is quite minimal.\r\n- Created a tool to handle a PyMedPhys config file, by default stored within\r\n  `~/.pymedphys/.config.toml`. That config file can have a `redirect` field\r\n  to allow configuration to be stored in a different location such as\r\n  within a git repo, or a network drive.\r\n- `pymedphys.zip_data_paths` now has a new optional parameter\r\n  `extract_directory`. When this parameter is passed the contents of the zip\r\n  downloaded zip data will be extracted to the provided directory. For example\r\n  now the following is possible:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pathlib\r\nimport pymedphys\r\n\r\nCWD = pathlib.Path.cwd()\r\npymedphys.zip_data_paths(\"mu-density-gui-e2e-data.zip\", extract_directory=CWD)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `pymedphys.Delivery.from_dicom()` now supports step and shoot and 3DCRT DICOM\r\n  plan files.\r\n- Work on `pymedphys.Delivery.from_monaco()` was undergone with an attempt to\r\n  support step and shoot plans. This work was preliminary.\r\n- Created a utility to pretty print patient names\r\n- Added ground work for e2e testing of `pymedphys gui` with the cypress tool."}

However, please bear in mind that the\r\n  entire API that is currently exposed will likely change before a 1.0.0\r\n  release.\r\n- `anonymise_dicom_dataset()` has been renamed to `anonymise_dataset()` to\r\n  remove redundant labelling.\r\n- `mu_density_from_delivery_data` moved from the `msq` module to the\r\n  `mudensity` module.\r\n- `compare_mosaiq_fields` moved from the `msq` module into the `plancompare`\r\n  module.\r\n- `pymedphys.dicom.get_structure_aligned_cube` has had its `x0` paremeter\r\n  changed from required to optional. It is no longer the first parameter\r\n  passed to the function. By default `x0` is now determined using the min/max\r\n  bounds of the structure.\r\n- The DICOM coordinate extraction functions - `extract_dicom_patient_xyz()`,\r\n  `extract_iec_patient_xyz()` and `extract_iec_fixed_xyz()` - have been\r\n  combined into a single function called `xyz_from_dataset()`. The x, y, z axes\r\n  can still be returned in either the DICOM, IEC fixed or IEC patient\r\n  coordinate systems by passing the following case-insensitive strings to the\r\n  `coord_system=` parameter of `xyz_from_dataset()`:\r\n  - DICOM: `'d'` or `'DICOM'`\r\n  - IEC fixed: `'f'`, `'fixed'` or `'IEC fixed'`\r\n  - IEC patient: `'p'`, `'patient'` or `'IEC patient'`\r\n- `gamma_dicom` now take datasets as opposed to filenames\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- A DICOM anonymsation CLI! See\r\n  [the DICOM Files CLI docs](../user/interfaces/cli/dicom.rst).\r\n- `anonymise_file()` and `anonymise_directory()`:\r\n  - two new DICOM anonymisation\r\n    wrapper functions that take a DICOM file and a directory as respective\r\n    arguments.\r\n- `is_anonymised_dataset()`, `is_anonymised_file()` and\r\n  `is_anonymised_directory()`:\r\n  - three new functions that check whether a pydicom\r\n    dataset, a DICOM file or all files within a directory have been anonymised,\r\n    respectively.\r\n- `coords_from_xyz_axes()` is a previously internal function that has now been\r\n  exposed in the API. It converts x, y, z axes returned by `xyz_from_dataset()`\r\n  into a full grid of coordinate triplets that correspond to the original grid\r\n  (pixel array or dose grid).\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n[See the code comparison to last release](https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/compare/v0.7.2...v0.8.0)"}

Might someday\r\n    contain methods such as `resample` and the like.\r\n  - `DicomSeries`, a series of `DicomImage` objects creating a CT dataset.\r\n  - `DicomStructure`, designed to house DICOM structure datasets.\r\n  - `DicomPlan`, a class that holds RT plan DICOM datasets.\r\n  - `DicomDose`, a class that to hold RT DICOM dose datasets. It has helper\r\n    functions and parameters such as coordinate transforms built into it.\r\n  - `DicomStudy`, a class designed to hold an interrelated set of `DicomDose`,\r\n    `DicomPlan`, `DicomStructure`, and `DicomSeries`. Not every type is\r\n    required to create a `DicomStudy`. Certain methods will be\r\n    available on `DicomStudy` depending what is housed within it. For example\r\n    having both `DicomDose` and `DicomStructure` should enable DVH based\r\n    methods.\r\n  - `DicomCollection`, a class that can hold multiple studies, interrelated or\r\n    not. A common use case that will likely be implemented is\r\n    `DicomCollection.from_directory(directory_path)` which would pull all DICOM\r\n    files nested within a directory and sort them into `DicomStudy` objects\r\n    based on their header UIDs.\r\n- Added CLI commands for a WIP docker server, logfile orchestration, and DICOM\r\n  editor tools.\r\n- Added a range of xlwings tools that allow the use of PyMedPhys functions\r\n  within Excel\r\n- Added rudimentary code to pull profiles from Mephysto\r\n  files.\r\n- The previously separate `decodetrf` library is now distributed within\r\n  PyMedPhys. You can now simply install PyMedPhys and run\r\n  `pymedphys trf to-csv` within the command line to convert `.trf` files into\r\n  `.csv` files.\r\n"}

Anything that makes use of this code will need to be\r\n  adjusted accordingly. Required changes include:\r\n    - `pymedphys.dcm` --> `pymedphys.dicom`\r\n    - `coords_and_dose_from_dcm()` --> `coords_and_dose_from_dicom()`\r\n    - `dcmfromdict()` --> `dicom_dataset_from_dict()`\r\n    - `gamma_dcm()` --> `gamma_dicom()`\r\n- MU Density related functions are no longer available under the `pymedphys.coll` package,\r\n  instead they are found within `pymedphys.mudensity` package.\r\n- The DICOM coordinate extraction functions now return simple tuples rather than `Coords` namedtuples:\r\n    - `extract_dicom_patient_xyz()`\r\n    - `extract_iec_patient_xyz()`\r\n    - `extract_iec_fixed_xyz()` \r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n- DICOM anonymisation now permits replacing deidentified values with suitable \"dummy\" values. This helps to\r\n  maintain compatibility with DICOM software that includes checks (beyond those specified in the DICOM Standard)\r\n  of valid DICOM tag values. Replacing tags with dummy values upon anonymisation is now the default behaviour.\r\n- A set of 3D coordinate transformation functions, including rotations (passive or active) and translations.\r\n  Transformations may be applied to a single coordinate triplet (an `ndarray`) or a list of arbitrarily many\r\n  coordinate triplets (a 3 x n `ndarray`). **NB**: Documentation forthcoming. \r\n\r\n### Code Refactoring\r\n- All uses of `dcm` as a variable name for instances of PyDicom Datasets have been converted to `ds` to\r\n  match PyDicom convention."}
