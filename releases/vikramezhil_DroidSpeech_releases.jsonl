This proved to be a downfall for third party developers to optimise the user experience of having continuous speech recognition after each speech result. Adding to this the speech recognition server throws up an error when called upon frequently thus preventing an error free experience to the end user. \r\n\r\nDroid Speech aims to close this gap and provide unparalleled optimisation of continuous speech recognition without any of the above said issues. It is developed keeping in mind all the loopholes which needs to be blocked to have the speech recognition run seamlessly in a android device.\r\n\r\nThis is the first release of Droid Speech - v1.0.0 and many more to come hopefully :-)"}
