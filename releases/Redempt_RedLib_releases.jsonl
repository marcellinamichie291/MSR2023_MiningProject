Useful for when you just need to assert that certain context is true or exists, but don't need the actual data beyond that.\r\n- Created ArgType, which is the exact same as CommandArgumentType. CommandArgumentType can make your lines of code quite long, so ArgType just acts as an alias.\r\n- Made CommandCollection coalesce multiple base commands with the same names/aliases into a single command which will attempt to run all of the commands until one is successful. This behavior is now consistent with how subcommands always worked, and simplifies command writing further."}
