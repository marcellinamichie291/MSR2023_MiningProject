In addition, the docs cover frequently asked questions as well as notes to keep in mind when performing replication. \n\nThe code has also been refactored down to the fundamental components only, stripping away other complicated and unnecessary dependencies. This should make the library much easier to understand, and a lot less cumbersome to manage as a client-side solution. \n"}
