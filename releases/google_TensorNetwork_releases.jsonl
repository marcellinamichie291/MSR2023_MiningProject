Simple do `node[:3]` to get the edges for the first 3 axes in a node.\r\n* Contraction algorithms for `optimal`, `branch` and `greedy` now require an `output_edge_order` when there is more than one dangling edge in the network.

We will be removing `net.add_copy_node` in the future.\r\n* Added `net.split_node_qr` and `net.split_node_rq` methods that do QR decomposition of a `Node`.\r\n* Added `net.copy` operation that will copy a `TensorNetwork`. This copied network will keep the same tensors objects between the two nodes. This is to make taking gradients of nodes relative to the final contracted value much easier.\r\n* Added a `conj` option to `net.copy(conj=True)`. This will copy the `TensorNetwork` and conjugate all of the tensors in the network. This is useful for calculating things like reduced density matrices. \r\n* Added `net.save(..)` and `tensornetwork.load(...)` methods for saving and loading a `TensorNetwork` object. \r\n* Removed support for python 3.5.
