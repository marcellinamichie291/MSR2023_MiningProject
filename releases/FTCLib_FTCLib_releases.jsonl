This is a rather large update to FTCLib that improves quite a bit of features based on input from our users and advisors. Thank you all for using our library and wanting to see it grow and improve.\r\n\r\nWe have switched our license from the MIT License to the FIRST BSD license to conform with the WPILib guidelines. We have also migrated to Maven Central due to the unfortunate sunset of Bintray.\r\n\r\n## Core\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n* Fixed the `Timer` subclass to work properly based on actual `ElapsedTime` behavior\r\n* Motors return actual velocity rather than the target\r\n* `CommandScheduler` now checks to see if the run loop is currently active to prevent a `ConcurrentModificationException`\r\n* Vector projection in `Vector2d` now uses the correct formula\r\n* Removed utilization of `setVelocity()` for `DcMotorEx` in `MotorEx` which forced the SDK RunMode to become RUN_USING_ENCODERS\r\n* PIDFController no longer returns true initially until `calculate()` is called by recalculating error in `setSetPoint()`\r\n* Invalid logic in sensor hardware classes\r\n* Fixed the issue with encoder reset not working if the direction is reversed\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n* `SimpleServo` uses `AngleUnit` to allow for rotation in both radians and degrees\r\n* Add `RunCommand`, `StartEndCommand`, and `LogCatCommand`\r\n* Added a kA gain option to the internal feedforward controller of the motors\r\n* PID modes now use the actual motor velocity rather than target velocity\r\n* A target distance can now be set for `PositionControl` mode which utilizes the distance per pulse configuration\r\n* `GamepadEx` now incorporates `ButtonReader` and `GamepadButton` so separate objects do not have to be made (see the gitbook and [this example](https://github.com/FTCLib/FTCLib/blob/dev/examples/src/main/java/com/example/ftclibexamples/GamepadSample.java) for more information)\r\n* The `LUT` class now uses a `TreeMap` for better efficiency\r\n* Added a \"between commands\" toggle mode for triggers and buttons (overloaded `toggleWhenActive`/`toggleWhenPressed`)\r\n* Added kotlin samples for the extensions\r\n* Styling of the sensor classes to be more in-line with the rest of FTCLib\r\n* Added a buffer to the motors in the case of PID not working under load\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n* `ServoEx` method `rotate()` was renamed `rotateBy()` and `rotateAngle()` was renamed `rotateByAngle()`\r\n* `SimpleServo` constructor was modified to fit the new `AngleUnit` utility methods\r\n* `RevColorSensorV3` was removed\r\n* Removed P controller from `CRServo`\r\n\r\n## Vision\r\n\r\n* Added portrait mode to contour detector\r\n* Made `UGCountourRingDetector` a usable product rather than an example\r\n* Added samples for the starter stack detectors and pipelines\r\n* Made camera width, height, and orientation modifiable for both starter stack detectors\r\n* Added high goal pipelines\r\n\r\n## Issues and Feature Requests\r\n\r\nThank you for using FTCLib. We received great feedback and results from our open beta for this version. If you're interested in working with us for our next open beta or testing in general, feel free to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/DFJ9Vh8). We also greatly appreciate issue opening for feature requests and bug reports. They help us keep track of project development and maintain good version history."}

We have also added new collaborators: @puravdatta-sudo, @Jaiming724, and @JarnaChao09.\r\n\r\n## What changed?\r\n* Hardware has been un-abstracted as it was too confusing for the user and didn't match the style of the rest of FTCLib\r\n* Added a CommandOpMode for a more FTC-like paradigm\r\n* Removed a few extraneous and unexplainable features from the controllers and drivebases\r\n* Restructured the repository to be more easily navigable\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n* Fixed the issue with commands being ended unless they were set to `runsWhenDisabled` being true\r\n* Fixed slow acceleration in holonomic and mecanum drive methods\r\n* Fixed encoder overflow for velocity\r\n* Removed reliance on constant period value for PID controllers\r\n* Fixed random reversing in the pure pursuit utils"}

Hardware has been rewritten for streamlining purposes and is now infinitely easier to understand and implement. A few untested drivebases were removed, and pure pursuit is a new addition to the mix of path followers.\r\n\r\nOur **biggest** update is our documentation, which is now fully updated for everything featured in FTCLib. You can find our documentation [here](http://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib/). Please make sure to read it thoroughly!\r\n\r\n## I have some issues...\r\n\r\nNo worries!
