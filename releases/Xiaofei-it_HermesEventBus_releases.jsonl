This is meant to eliminate the write-after-write hazard and the read-after-write hazard, but makes the IPC slower.\n\nThis version improves the performance of the IPC to make it faster from the following aspects:\n1. When the service is being connected, move the incoming actions and calculations into a queue.\n2. After the service has been connected, perform the pending actions and calculations in the queue.\n3. Before the pending actions and calculations has been performed, any incoming action or calculation will also be added into the queue to eliminate the write-after-write hazard and the read-after-write hazard.\n4. After the pending actions and calculations has been performed, the subsequent actions and calculations will be performed immediately without synchronization.\n"}

Fix a bug which will cause the failure of connection when sending and receiving events between apps.\n2. Fix a potential bug: Suppose that a sub-process sends an event to the main process before it finishes the connection to the main process. And the main process sends an event to the sub-process immediately after it receives the event sent from the sub-process. Then the sub-process will not receive the event sent from the main process.\n\n### New features and enhancements\n1. Add more annotations on `MainService` and `SubService`.\n2. Allow a user to re-initialize HermesEventBus after invoking `HermesEventBus.destroy()`.\n"}
