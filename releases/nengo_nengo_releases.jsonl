([#1648](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1648))\r\n-   Added the `ConvolutionTranspose` transform to perform transposed convolution. It is commonly used for various forms of upsampling in deep networks. ([#1648](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1648))\r\n-   Added `Conv` and `ConvTranspose` aliases for `Convolution` and `ConvolutionTranspose`.

([\\#1589](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1589))\r\n - Added the `step_order` attribute to `nengo.Simulator`, which contains an ordered list of the operations run on each timestep. ([\\#1615](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1615))\r\n - Added the `make_state` method to `NeuronType`, which initializes the neuron type's state variables. ([\\#1609](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1609))\r\n - Added the `spiking` attribute to `NeuronType`, which exposes whether a neuron type is spiking or non-spiking. ([\\#1609](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1609))\r\n - Added the `negative` attribute to `NeuronType`, which indicates whether the neuron type can have negative outputs. ([\\#1609](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1609))\r\n - Added the `Tanh` neuron type to simulate hyperbolic tangent neurons. ([\\#1609](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1609))\r\n - Added the `RatesToSpikesNeuronType`, which is a base class for neuron types that convert a rate-based type to a spiking one. ([\\#1609](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1609))\r\n - Added the `RegularSpiking` neuron type, which emits regularly-spaced spikes at the rate specified by its base type. ([\\#1609](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1609))\r\n - Added the `StochasticSpiking` neuron type, which emits spikes based on stochastic rounding to roughly match the rate specified by its base type. ([\\#1609](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1609))\r\n - Added the `PoissonSpiking` neuron type, which emits Poisson-distributed spikes, as are commonly used to match biological spiking statistics. ([\\#1609](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1609))\r\n - Added the `PositiveNeuronType` test argument to run tests on all neuron types for which `negative` is not `True`. ([\\#1609](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1609))\r\n - Added the `QuasirandomSequence` distribution, which is similar to `Uniform` but spreads points across the space evenly. ([\\#1611](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1611))\r\n - Added the `ScatteredHypersphere` distribution, which is similar to `UniformHypersphere` but spreads points across the space more evenly. ([\\#1611](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1611))\r\n - Added the `RLS` (recursive least-squares) learning rule, which is an online version of the least-squares method typically used for offline decoder-solving. ([\\#1611](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1611), [example](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/examples/learning/learn-product.html))\r\n - Added the `SimProbe` operator, which marks a signal as being probed. ([\\#1653](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1653))\r\n\r\n**Changed**\r\n\r\n - Nengo is now compatible with Python 3.8. ([\\#1628](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1628))\r\n - The default Connection transform is now `None`, meaning that there will be no transform applied. This only changes behavior when learning on a neuron-neuron connection with the default scalar transform. In that situation there are now no weights to apply learning to, so this will result in an error. The old behaviour can be obtained by setting `transform=1`. ([\\#1591](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1591))\r\n - Network list attributes (e.g. `.ensembles`, `.connections`, `.probes`) are now read-only, to prevent users from accidentally overwriting them with their own data. ([\\#1545](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1545), [\\#1608](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1608))\r\n - The `NeuronType.step_math` method has been renamed to `NeuronType.step`. ([\\#1609](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1609))\r\n - Neuron types can now create arbitrary state variables without needing to register a new build function. The `state` class attribute declares the neuron type's state variables and their default initial values. All `__init__` methods accept an `initial_state` dictionary for users to override the default initial state values. ([\\#1609](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1609))\r\n - The `nl` and `nl_nodirect` test arguments have been renamed to `AnyNeuronType` and `NonDirectNeuronType`. ([\\#1609](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1609))\r\n - Weight solvers (i.e. those with `weights=True`) are now allowed on all connections. For connections that are not between `Ensembles`, though, weight solvers have the same effects as solvers with `weights=False`, and a warning will be raised. ([\\#1626](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1626))\r\n - Various improvements to simulation speed. ([\\#1629](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1629))\r\n - `EnsembleArray` now raises an error if `add_output` would overwrite an existing attribute. ([\\#1611](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1611))\r\n - The `encoders` and `eval_points` of `Ensemble` are now sampled from `ScatteredHypersphere` by default. ([\\#1611](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1611))\r\n\r\n**Deprecated**\r\n\r\n - `NeuronType.step` replaces the `NeuronType.step_math` method, which will be removed in Nengo 4.0.0. ([\\#1609](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1609))\r\n - `Connection.is_decoded` is deprecated, as the definition of whether a Connection is decoded or not was ambiguous. Instead we recommend directly checking the pre/post objects for the properties of interest. ([\\#1640](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1640))\r\n\r\n**Fixed**\r\n\r\n - Fixed a bug when comparing equality with `Ensemble.neurons` or `Connection.learning_rule` objects. ([\\#1588](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1588))\r\n - Fixed a bug preventing unpickling an `Ensemble`. ([\\#1598](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1598))\r\n - Fixed a bug in which unpickling a `Simulator` would rerun the optimizer. ([\\#1598](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1598))\r\n - Fixed a bug where the `LstsqDrop` solver errored when solving for zero weights. ([\\#1541](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1541), [\\#1607](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1607))\r\n - Fixed a bug in the validation of `Choice` distributions. ([\\#1630](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1630))\r\n - Fixed a bug where a `Signal` did not register as sharing memory with itself. ([\\#1627](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1627))\r\n - Fixed a shape error when applying PES learning to a neuron-to-neuron connection with a slice on the post-synaptic neurons. ([\\#1640](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1640))\r\n - Fixed a shape error when applying PES learning to a neuron-\\>ensemble connection with a weight solver. ([\\#1640](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1640))\r\n - Fixed a shape error when applying PES learning to an ensemble-\\>neuron connection. ([\\#1640](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1640))\r\n - Fixed a shape error when applying PES learning with a slice on the pre-synaptic object.

([\\#1428](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1428), [\\#1426](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1426))\r\n- Added support for convolutional connections. ([\\#1481](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1481))\r\n- Added version tracking to documentation, so that documentation from old versions remains available. ([\\#1488](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1488))\r\n- Added support for sparse connections. ([\\#1532](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1532))\r\n- Added a `fail_fast` setting to test operators when they are first added to the model. See [configuration options](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/nengorc.html#configuration-options) for details. ([\\#1532](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1532))\r\n- Added a `--memory` option for pytest that prints the total memory consumed by the tests when they complete (Linux and Mac OS X only). ([\\#640](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/640))\r\n- Added a bit precision setting to change the number of bits allocated to each value tracked by Nengo. ([\\#640](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/640))\r\n- Added a `Simulator.clear_probes` method to clear probe data. This method can be used before pickling to reduce the pickle file size. ([\\#1387](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1387))\r\n- Nengo tests now use the `allclose` fixture from `pytest-allclose`, which makes it possible for backends to change test tolerances. ([\\#1563](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1563))\r\n- Nengo tests now use the `rng` and `seed` fixtures from `pytest-rng`. ([\\#1566](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1566))\r\n- Nengo tests now use the `plt` fixture from `pytest-plt`. ([\\#1566](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1566))\r\n- Added a `nengo_simloader` pytest option for specifying a callable that takes a pytest `request` and returns a callable to be used as `Simulator` in the Nengo test suite. ([\\#1566](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1566))\r\n- Added more content to the API reference documentation. ([\\#1578](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1578))\r\n\r\n**Changed**\r\n\r\n- Python 2 is no longer supported. The oldest supported Python version is 3.5. ([\\#1520](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1520), [python3statement.org](https://python3statement.org/))\r\n- Nengo no longer supports Python 3.4. Official 3.4 support ended in March 2019. ([PEP-429](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0429/), [\\#1514](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1514))\r\n- Replaced the `dt` argument to `Simulator.trange` with `sample_every` because `dt` would return values that the simulator had not simulated. `dt` is now an alias for `sample_every` and will be removed in the future. ([\\#1368](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1368), [\\#1384](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1384))\r\n- Dense connection transforms (this includes all previously supported values for `Connection.transform`) will now be represented internally as `nengo.Dense` objects. Arrays/scalars can still be passed as `transform` values, and they will be automatically converted to the equivalent `nengo.Dense` object. Retrieving the value of `my_conn.transform` will return that `Dense` object. The original input array can be retrieved through `my_conn.transform.init`. ([\\#1481](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1481))\r\n- `nengo.solvers.NoSolver(w, weights=True)` now expects `w` to have shape `(pre.n_neurons, function_d)`, rather than `pre.n_neurons, post.n_neurons)`. That is, with `NoSolver` you are always specifying the values for the decoders, and encoders/transform will be applied automatically to those decoders (as occurs with all other solvers). Note that this does not affect `NoSolver(..., weights=False)` (the default). ([\\#1481](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1481))\r\n- Increased minimum NumPy version to 1.11.0. See our [instructions for installing NumPy](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/getting-started.html#installing-numpy) if you need to upgrade. ([\\#1481](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1481))\r\n- Solvers are now explicitly marked as compositional or non-compositional depending on whether they must act on full connection weight matrices when solving for weights. ([\\#1507](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1507))\r\n- Solvers no longer take encoders as an argument. Instead, encoders will be applied to the targets before the solve function for non-compositional solvers and applied by the Transform builder for compositional solvers. ([\\#1507](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1507))\r\n- Example Jupyter notebooks have been upgraded to notebook format 4. ([\\#1440](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1440))\r\n- Switched documentation to new [nengo-sphinx-theme](https://github.com/nengo/nengo-sphinx-theme). ([\\#1489](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1489))\r\n- The `settled_firingrate` function has been moved from `nengo.utils.neurons` to `nengo.neurons`. ([\\#1187](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1187))\r\n- Added new pytest config option, `nengo_test_unsupported` (replacing the previous `Simulator.unsupported` functionality). ([\\#1521](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1521))\r\n- Switched to nengo-bones templating system for TravisCI config/scripts. ([\\#1514](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1514))\r\n- The `NeuronType.current` and `NeuronType.rates` methods now document the supported shapes of parameters and return values. ([\\#1437](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1437))\r\n- PES learning updates are now applied on the next timestep rather than the current one. ([\\#1398](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1398))\r\n- The `NdarrayParam` now accepts a `dtype` argument to check that data assigned to that parameter matches the given Numpy `dtype`. `DistOrArrayParam` accepts an analogous `sample_dtype` argument. ([\\#1532](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1532))\r\n- We no longer test operators when they are initially added to the model, which speed up build times slightly. To re-enable this testing, enable the `fail_fast` RC setting. ([\\#1532](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1532))\r\n- `LinearFilter` now uses state space representations internally, which is faster and potentially more accurate. ([\\#1535](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1535))\r\n- The default value of `y0` in `Synapse.filt` is now 0 instead of the initial value of the input signal. This allows unstable filters (e.g., integrators) to be used with `filt`. ([\\#1535](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1535))\r\n- `LinearFilter` now accepts the discretization method as an argument, rather than having it specified in `make_step`. ([\\#1535](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1535))\r\n- The `synapse_kwargs` argument to `FilteredNoise` has been removed. ([\\#1535](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1535))\r\n- Processes with internal state now declare that state by defining a `make_state` method and accepting a `state` parameter in `make_step`. ([\\#1387](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1387))\r\n- `Simulator` is now pickleable, allowing its state to be saved and loaded. ([\\#1387](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1387))\r\n- Renamed `utils.testing.allclose` to `utils.testing.signals_allclose`, to differentiate it from the `allclose` fixture. ([\\#1563](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1563))\r\n- The default `intercepts` value has been changed to `Uniform(-1, 0.9)` to avoid high gains when intercepts are close to 1. ([\\#1534](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1534), [\\#1561](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1561))\r\n- The `--simulator` and `--neurons` pytest command line arguments are now specified by `nengo_simulator` and `nengo_neurons` entries in the pytest config file instead. ([\\#1566](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1566))\r\n- The `nengo_test_unsupported` option now uses pytest nodeids for the test names (the main change is that this means a double `::` between file and function names). ([\\#1566](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1566))\r\n- `Signals` will now raise an error if their initial value contains NaNs.

([\\#1304])\r\n-   The error raised when a `Connection` function returns `None` is now more clear. ([\\#1319])\r\n-   We now raise an error when a `Connection` transform is set to `None`. ([\\#1326])\r\n\r\n**Fixed**\r\n\r\n-   Probe cache is now cleared on simulator reset. ([\\#1324])\r\n-   Neural gains are now always applied after the synapse model. Previously, this was the case for decoded connections but not neuron-to-neuron connections. ([\\#1330])\r\n-   Fixed a crash when a lock cannot be acquired while shrinking the cache.

Unlike non-process\n  callables, processes are properly reset when a simulator is reset.\n  See the `processes.ipynb` example notebook, or the API documentation\n  for more details. ([#590](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/590),\n  [#652](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/652),\n  [#945](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/945),\n  [#955](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/955))\n-   Spiking `LIF` neuron models now accept an additional argument,\n  `min_voltage`. Voltages are clipped such that they do not drop below\n  this value (previously, this was fixed at 0).\n  ([#666](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/666))\n-   The `PES` learning rule no longer accepts a connection as an\n  argument. Instead, error information is transmitted by making a\n  connection to the learning rule object (e.g.,\n  `nengo.Connection(error_ensemble, connection.learning_rule)`.\n  ([#344](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/344),\n  [#642](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/642))\n-   The `modulatory` attribute has been removed from `nengo.Connection`.\n  This was only used for learning rules to this point, and has been\n  removed in favor of connecting directly to the learning rule.\n  ([#642](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/642))\n-   Connection weights can now be probed with\n  `nengo.Probe(conn, 'weights')`, and these are always the weights\n  that will change with learning regardless of the type of connection.\n  Previously, either `decoders` or `transform` may have changed\n  depending on the type of connection; it is now no longer possible to\n  probe `decoders` or `transform`.\n  ([#729](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/729))\n-   A version of the AssociativeMemory SPA module is now available as a\n  stand-alone network in `nengo.networks`. The AssociativeMemory SPA\n  module also has an updated argument list.\n  ([#702](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/702))\n-   The `Product` and `InputGatedMemory` networks no longer accept a\n  `config` argument.\n  ([#814](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/814))\n-   The `EnsembleArray` network's `neuron_nodes` argument is deprecated.\n  Instead, call the new `add_neuron_input` or `add_neuron_output`\n  methods. ([#868](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/868))\n-   The `nengo.log` utility function now takes a string `level`\n  parameter to specify any logging level, instead of the old binary\n  `debug` parameter. Cache messages are logged at DEBUG instead of\n  INFO level. ([#883](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/883))\n-   Reorganised the Associative Memory code, including removing many\n  extra parameters from `nengo.networks.assoc_mem.AssociativeMemory`\n  and modifying the defaults of others.\n  ([#797](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/797))\n-   Add `close` method to `Simulator`. `Simulator` can now be used used\n  as a context manager.\n  ([#857](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/857),\n  [#739](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/739),\n  [#859](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/859))\n-   Most exceptions that Nengo can raise are now custom exception\n  classes that can be found in the `nengo.exceptions` module.\n  ([#781](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/781))\n-   All Nengo objects (`Connection`, `Ensemble`, `Node`, and `Probe`)\n  now accept a `label` and `seed` argument if they didn't previously.\n  ([#958](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/859))\n-   In `nengo.synapses`, `filt` and `filtfilt` are deprecated. Every\n  synapse type now has `filt` and `filtfilt` methods that filter using\n  the synapse. ([#945](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/945))\n-   `Connection` objects can now accept a `Distribution` for the\n  transform argument; the transform matrix will be sampled from that\n  distribution when the model is built.\n  ([#979](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/979)).\n\n**Behavioural changes**\n-   The sign on the `PES` learning rule's error has been flipped to\n  conform with most learning rules, in which error is minimized. The\n  error should be `actual - target`.\n  ([#642](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/642))\n-   The `PES` rule's learning rate is invariant to the number of neurons\n  in the presynaptic population. The effective speed of learning\n  should now be unaffected by changes in the size of the presynaptic\n  population. Existing learning networks may need to be updated; to\n  achieve identical behavior, scale the learning rate by\n  `pre.n_neurons / 100`.\n  ([#643](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/643))\n-   The `probeable` attribute of all Nengo objects is now implemented as\n  a property, rather than a configurable parameter.\n  ([#671](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/671))\n-   Node functions receive `x` as a copied NumPy array (instead of a\n  readonly view). ([#716](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/716),\n  [#722](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/722))\n-   The SPA Compare module produces a scalar output (instead of a\n  specific vector).\n  ([#775](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/775),\n  [#782](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/782))\n-   Bias nodes in `spa.Cortical`, and gate ensembles and connections in\n  `spa.Thalamus` are now stored in the target modules.\n  ([#894](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/894),\n  [#906](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/906))\n-   The `filt` and `filtfilt` functions on `Synapse` now use the initial\n  value of the input signal to initialize the filter output\n  by default. This provides more accurate filtering at the beginning\n  of the signal, for signals that do not start at zero.\n  ([#945](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/945))\n\n**Improvements**\n-   Added `Ensemble.noise` attribute, which injects noise directly into\n  neurons according to a stochastic `Process`.\n  ([#590](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/590))\n-   Added a `randomized_svd` subsolver for the L2 solvers. This can be\n  much quicker for large numbers of neurons or evaluation points.\n  ([#803](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/803))\n-   Added `PES.pre_tau` attribute, which sets the time constant on a\n  lowpass filter of the presynaptic activity.\n  ([#643](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/643))\n-   `EnsembleArray.add_output` now accepts a list of functions to be\n  computed by each ensemble.\n  ([#562](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/562),\n  [#580](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/580))\n-   `LinearFilter` now has an `analog` argument which can be set through\n  its constructor. Linear filters with digital coefficients can be\n  specified by setting `analog` to `False`.\n  ([#819](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/819))\n-   Added `SqrtBeta` distribution, which describes the distribution of\n  semantic pointer elements.\n  ([#414](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/414),\n  [#430](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/430))\n-   Added `Triangle` synapse, which filters with a triangular FIR\n  filter. ([#660](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/660))\n-   Added `utils.connection.eval_point_decoding` function, which\n  provides a connection's static decoding of a list of evaluation\n  points. ([#700](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/700))\n-   Resetting the Simulator now resets all Processes, meaning the\n  injected random signals and noise are identical between runs, unless\n  the seed is changed (which can be done through `Simulator.reset`).\n  ([#582](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/582),\n  [#616](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/616),\n  [#652](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/652))\n-   An exception is raised if SPA modules are not properly assigned to\n  an SPA attribute.\n  ([#730](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/730),\n  [#791](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/791))\n-   The `Product` network is now more accurate.\n  ([#651](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/651))\n-   Numpy arrays can now be used as indices for slicing objects.\n  ([#754](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/754))\n-   `Config.configures` now accepts multiple classes rather than\n  just one. ([#842](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/842))\n-   Added `add` method to `spa.Actions`, which allows actions to be\n  added after module has been initialized.\n  ([#861](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/861),\n  [#862](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/862))\n-   Added SPA wrapper for circular convolution networks, `spa.Bind`\n  ([#849](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/849))\n-   Added the `Voja` (Vector Oja) learning rule type, which updates an\n  ensemble's encoders to fire selectively for its inputs. (see\n  `examples/learning/learn_associations.ipynb`).\n  ([#727](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/727))\n-   Added a clipped exponential distribution useful for thresholding, in\n  particular in the AssociativeMemory.\n  ([#779](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/779))\n-   Added a cosine similarity distribution, which is the distribution of\n  the cosine of the angle between two random vectors. It is useful for\n  setting intercepts, in particular when using the `Voja` learning\n  rule. ([#768](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/768))\n-   `nengo.synapses.LinearFilter` now has an `evaluate` method to\n  evaluate the filter response to sine waves of given frequencies.\n  This can be used to create Bode plots, for example.\n  ([#945](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/945))\n-   `nengo.spa.Vocabulary` objects now have a `readonly` attribute that\n  can be used to disallow adding new semantic pointers. Vocabulary\n  subsets are read-only by default.\n  ([#699](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/699))\n-   Improved performance of the decoder cache by writing all decoders of\n  a network into a single file.\n  ([#946](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/946))\n\n**Bug fixes**\n-   Fixed issue where setting `Connection.seed` through the constructor\n  had no effect. ([#724](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/725))\n-   Fixed issue in which learning connections could not be sliced.\n  ([#632](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/632))\n-   Fixed issue when probing scalar transforms.\n  ([#667](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/667),\n  [#671](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/671))\n-   Fix for SPA actions that route to a module with multiple inputs.\n  ([#714](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/714))\n-   Corrected the `rmses` values in `BuiltConnection.solver_info` when\n  using `NNls` and `Nnl2sL2` solvers, and the `reg` argument for\n  `Nnl2sL2`. ([#839](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/839))\n-   `spa.Vocabulary.create_pointer` now respects the specified number of\n  creation attempts, and returns the most dissimilar pointer if none\n  can be found below the similarity threshold.\n  ([#817](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/817))\n-   Probing a Connection's output now returns the output of that\n  individual Connection, rather than the input to the Connection's\n  post Ensemble. ([#973](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/973),\n  [#974](https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/974))\n-   Fixed thread-safety of using networks and config in `with`\n  statements.
