Possible use cases could be submitting to a render farm, or publishing to a different location.\r\n\r\nTargets work the same way as families, so a wildcard of ```*``` enables the plugin for all targets.

Include on exact match (note order is independent)\nassert set([\"a\", \"b\"]) == set([\"b\", \"a\"])\n```\n\nThe default value for this parameter is `api.Intersection` to preserve backwards compatibility. The last possible value is `api.Exact` which means an instance only matches when families of both instance and plug-ins match _exactly_.\n\n``` python\nclass EdgeCasePlugin(api.InstancePlugin):\n  families = [\"model\", \"low\", \"level21\"]\n  match = api.Exact\n\n  def process(self, instance):\n    assert \"specialMember\" in instance\n```\n\nSee [`test_logic.py`](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-base/blob/6dc5781d6bb7b97fb7bc9df268f59e24a477c272/tests/test_logic.py#L82) for complete examples.\n"}

The change is **fully backwards compatible** and will continue to support the prior ways of working until the next major version change (2.0), but users are recommended to transition and will likely find the change an improvement.\n- [Discussion](http://forums.pyblish.com/t/making-plug-ins-more-explicit/143)\n- [Issue](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-base/issues/242)\n\n### Callbacks\n\nThis new feature enables developers to listen for events taking place throughout Pyblish and surrounding applications, such as the GUI.\n\n``` python\nimport pyblish.api\n\ndef on_published(context):\n  has_error = any(result[\"error\"] is not None for result in context.data[\"results\"])\n  print(\"Publishing %s\" % (\"finished\" if has_error else \"failed\"))\n\npyblish.api.register_callback(\"published\", on_published)\n```\n\nFor a list of supported events, see here.\n- [Supported events](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish.api/wiki/Events)\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n#### What has changed?\n\nLeaving the details of this change to the two links provided above, here's the gist of it. The workflow and mindset of the developer remains the same, but implementation differs in that the superclasses no longer behave differently based on their argument signature.\n\nAs you (may not) know, `process(self, context)` behaves differently from `process(self, context, instance)`. This behaviour was confusing and led to a lot of odd corner cases that were difficult to debug.\n\nInstead, the superclass - `ContextPlugin` or `InstancePlugin` - now determines a fixed behaviour for your plug-ins, where their ordering is instead based solely on the `order` attribute and CVEI provided as named integers, such as `pyblish.api.CollectorOrder`.\n\n``` python\nclass MyCollector(pyblish.api.ContextPlugin):\n  order = pyblish.api.CollectorOrder\n\n  def process(self, context):\n    ...\n\nclass MyValidator(pyblish.api.InstancePlugin):\n  order = pyblish.api.ValidatorOrder\n\n  def process(self, instance):\n    ...\n```\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n#### Transition Guide\n\nIn general, you can simply replace your superclass with the new superclass; either `ContextPlugin` or `InstancePlugin`, depending on whether your argument signature contained `context` or `instance` respectively.\n\nThere is one corner case.\n\n> I have both `instance` and `context` in my signature.\n\nIf so, subclass from `InstancePlugin` and remove `context` and instead get the context via `instance.context`.\n\n``` python\ndef process(self, instance):\n  context = instance.context\n```\n\nThe plug-in will continue to behave exactly as before.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### More changes\n- Simplified CLI\n- Retired vendors\n- Retired file-based configuration\n- Deprecation\n\n### Simplified CLI\n\nThe command-line interface no longer provides options for file-based configuration and data.\n\n``` bash\n$ pyblish publish\n```\n\nStoring a file called `data.yaml` in the current working directory when running this command caused the contained dictionary of data to be appended to the Context. This no longer happens.\n\nAdditionally, storing a file called `config.yaml` with plug-in paths would cause the contained paths to be appended to the `PYBLISHPLUGINPATH` when running the above command. This no longer happens.\n\n#### Retired Vendors\n\n`nose`, `yaml` and `coverage` are no longer included in this release. If you in depend on them (you shouldn't) then you will have to install them locally henceforth.\n\n`nose` and `coverage` was retired due to incompatibility with the forthcoming Python 3 support, and `yaml` due to no longer having support for file-based configuration.\n\n### Retired file-based configuration\n\nAt the dawn of Pyblish, plug-in paths were registered by editing a configuration file and storing it in your local home directory. The practice quickly grew cumbersome, as it was difficult to enable networked installs and varying the configuration based on various factors, such as project, software or user.\n\nInstead, environment variables were introduced to take on the weight, and they have been in use ever since.\n\nHopefully, this deprecation should not affect you and if it does then you find much greater flexibility in instead customising environment variables.\n\nIf you still have need for this feature, now is the time to speak up.\n\n### Deprecation\n\nSome internal details mostly relevant to developers of Pyblish or software that somehow uses Pyblish to function have changed and are facing deprecation.\n- pyblish.logic.process\n- Services\n\n`process` was previously used to determine what plug-in to run next and when to stop. But this practice proved too inflexible when it came to the GUI that needed direct control over this particular aspect.\n\nIn its place, there is now `pyblish.logic.Iterator` which simply provides the next pair of items to process, without actually processing them. For your own GUIs, this should prove more flexible, at the cost of having to implement more logic on your own.\n\nSee `pyblish.util.publish()` or pyblish-qml for examples of how to do that.\n\nServices are also deprecated. Their primary reason for existing was to facilitate dependency injection which is no longer needed thanks to the much simplified `ContextPlugin` and `InstancePlugin` classes.\n\nIf you have need for them, now is the time to speak up.\n"}

This family is then matched against supported families of each plug-in. Now, an instance can register multiple families; essentially changing places of how plug-ins and instances are matched. That is, instead of building a plug-in with support for multiple families, you can now think in terms of building instances with multiple families, and in that way register support for more than a single plug-in.\n\nSee the [issue](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-base/issues/231) for more details.\n"}

(#206)\n\n### Context getter\n\nYou can now reference `Instance`'s by \"id\" directly from a `Context`.\n\n``` bash\nimport pyblish.api\ncontext = pyblish.api.Context()\ncontext.create_instance(\"MyInstance\")\nmy_instance = context[\"MyInstance\"]\n```\n\n`id` is generally the same as an `Instance`'s `name`.\n\n### Host integration\n\nThis replaces the current behaviour and use of `pyblish.api.current_host()`.\n\nPractically, everything will still work, including `current_host()` (which is now deprecated, read on) with the added requirement that an integration **must** be loaded for plug-ins to filter against it.\n\nFor example, when you load Maya, it's the Pyblish for Maya integration that registers the host, `maya`. If this doesn't happen, then plug-ins filtered by `hosts = [\"maya\"]` won't run.\n\nYou have most likely already done this, as it's how Pyblish QML automatically registers itself as well, but in the rare case where you are using a host, along with plug-ins filtered by that host, but haven't registered the integration, you **will** notice a change in behaviour.\n\n#### New functions\n\nLike mentioned above, `current_host` is still alive and well, but is to be considered deprecated, as it will only return the **last registered host**. I've made it so that Maya, for example, registers `mayapy`, `mayabatch`, and `maya` in this order, meaning `current_host` will still return the expected `maya` for backwards compatibility.\n\nHenceforth, `registered_hosts()` is the official method with which to query which hosts are currently supported.\n\n``` bash\n>>> import pyblish.api\n>>> pyblish.api.registered_hosts()\n[\"python\", \"mayabatch\", \"mayapy\", \"maya\"]\n```\n\n`python` is automatically registered during initialisation, but can be removed, along with every other hosts, should you need, via `deregister_all_hosts()`.\n\nHere are all the new functions related to this functionality.\n- `register_host`\n- `registered_hosts`\n- `deregister_host`\n- `deregister_all_hosts`\n"}

It means that the current way of implementing plug-ins **still works**, but are to be considered deprecated and no longer supported.\n\nNow, on to the fun stuff!\n\n#### As Usual\n\n``` python\nimport pyblish.api\n\nclass ValidateInstances(pyblish.api.Validator):\n    def process(self, instance):\n        pass\n```\n\nThis does as you would expect. Which is to process once for every instance, regardless of family (see below for new family defaults).\n\n``` python\nimport pyblish.api\n\nclass SelectInstances(pyblish.api.Selector):\n    def process(self, context):\n        pass\n```\n\nIn the same spirit, this plug-in runs once and has access to the context. This is nothing new.\n\n#### Plug-in Independency\n\nWhat is new is that you can choose to process _nothing_.\n\n``` python\nimport pyblish.api\n\nclass SimpleExtractScene(pyblish.api.Extractor):\n    def process(self):\n        cmds.file(\"myfile.mb\", exportAll=True)\n```\n\nThis plug-in runs once, as when processing the `context`, but doesn't have access to either the current `Instance` nor `Context`. This can be useful for plug-ins that are completely independent of it's environment and state.\n\n#### Default Services\n\nWhat is also new is that you can also request _other_ so-called \"services\".\n\n``` python\nimport pyblish.api\n\nclass CustomValidator(pyblish.api.Validator):\n    def process(self, user, time):\n        fname = \"myfile_v001_%s_%s.mb\" % (user, time())\n        cmds.file(fname, exportAll=True)\n```\n\nIn which case the services `user`, `time` and `config` are injected into the plug-in during process. Each of which are default services that ship with the Pyblish base install.\n\nHere are all of them.\n\n``` python\nregister_service(\"user\", getpass.getuser())\nregister_service(\"time\", pyblish.lib.time)\nregister_service(\"config\", pyblish.api.config)\n```\n- `user` is available by value, as it is not expected to change at run-time.\n- `time` is callable, as it provides unique values each time it is used\n- `config` is shorthand to `pyblish.api.config`\n\n#### User Defined Services\n\nYou can also register your own services..\n\n``` python\ndef say(something, yell=False):\n    print(something.upper() if yell else something)\n\npyblish.api.register_service(say)\n```\n\n..and then request them via your plug-ins.\n\n``` python\nimport pyblish.api\n\nclass ValidateUniverse(pyblish.api.Validator):\n    def process(self, say):\n        say(\"I just wanted to say, Hello World!\", yell=True)\n```\n\n#### Service Coordination\n\nServices are shared amongst plug-ins.\n\n``` python\ndatastore = {\"softFailure\": False}\npyblish.api.register_service(\"store\", datastore)\n```\n\nWhich means you can use it to communicate and pass information inbetween them.\n\n``` python\nclass ValidatePrimary(pyblish.api.Validator):\n    def process(self, instance, store):\n        if instance.has_data(\"I'm kind of valid..\"):\n            store[\"softFailure\"] = True\n\n\nclass ValidateBackup(pyblish.api.Validator):\n    def process(self, instance, store):\n        if store[\"softFailure\"] is True:\n            # Do alternate validation\n```\n\nOr to provide globally accessible data, such as a database connection.\n\n``` python\nimport ftrack\nimport pyblish.api\nproxy = ftrack.ServerProxy(\"http://myaddress.ftrack.com\")\npyblish.api.register_service(\"ftrack\", proxy)\n```\n\n#### Distributed Development\n\nWith services, you can defer development of a plug-in between more than a single developer allowing for faster iteration times and improved version control.\n\nAs a plug-in is developed, requirements may arise..\n\n``` python\nimport pyblish.api\n\nclass ValidateSecretSauce(pyblish.api.Validator):\n    def process(self, instance, sauce):\n        if sauce.hot():\n            assert instance.has_data(\"hotCompatible\"), \"Sauce too hot!\"\n        assert instance.data(\"tasty\") == True, \"Sauce not tasty!\"\n```\n\nWhich can later be developed.\n\n``` python\nimport pyblish.api\nimport my_studio_tools\n\nclass Sauce(object):\n    def hot(self):\n        return my_studio_tools.hot_sauce()\n\npyblish.api.register_service(\"sauce\", Sauce())\n```\n\n#### Testing\n\nAs a final and important piece to the puzzle, dependency injection makes testing easier and more controllable.\n\n``` python\ndef test_plugin():\n    \"\"\"Testing of a host-dependent plug-in with DI\"\"\"\n    instances = list()\n\n    class SelectCharacters(pyblish.api.Validator):\n        def process(self, context, host):\n            for char in host.ls(\"*_char\"):\n                instance = context.create_instance(char, family=\"character\")\n                instance.add(host.listRelatives(char))\n                instances.append(instance.name)\n\n    class HostMock(object):\n        def ls(self, query):\n            return [\"bobby_char\", \"rocket_char\"]\n\n        def listRelatives(self, node):\n            if node == \"bobby_char\":\n                return [\"arm\", \"leg\"]\n            if node == \"rocket_char\":\n                return [\"propeller\"]\n            return []\n\n    pyblish.api.register_service(\"host\", HostMock())\n\n    for result in pyblish.logic.process(\n            func=pyblish.plugin.process,\n            plugins=[SelectCharacters],\n            context=pyblish.api.Context()):\n        assert_equals(result[\"error\"], None)\n\n    assert_equals(len(instances), 2)\n    assert_equals(instances, [\"bobby_char\", \"rocket_char\"])\n\n```\n\n**Related**\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish/issues/127)\n- [Forum thread](http://forums.pyblish.com/t/api-changes/51)\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Simple Plug-ins\n\nA new type of plug-in has been introduced; the superclass of the currently available Selection, Validation, Extraction and Conform (SVEC) plug-ins - called simply `Plugin`.\n\n``` python\nimport pyblish.api\n\nclass MyPlugin(pyblish.api.Plugin):\n  def process(self):\n    self.log.info(\"I'm simple\")\n```\n\nSimple plug-ins are just that, a simpler, less assuming variant of SVEC. Each inherit the exact same functionality and can be used in-place of any other plug-in, the only difference being a default order of `-1` meaning they will run _before_ any of it's siblings.\n\nOther than that, they are identical in every way. To make it into a Selector, simply assign it an appropriate order.\n\n``` python\nclass MySelector(pyblish.api.Plugin):\n  order = pyblish.api.Selector.order\n```\n\nMore importantly, simple plug-ins are meant as a stepping stone for beginners not yet familiar with SVEC, and as a bridge to unforseen use of Pyblish, allowing arbitrary use and boundless extensibility.\n\nWith this, Pyblish is now a generic automation framework with SVEC becoming a collection of best practices and recommended method of writing plug-ins.\n\n**Related**\n- [Forum thread](http://forums.pyblish.com/t/simpleplugin/60/16)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish/issues/186)\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### In-memory plug-ins\n\nThis new feature will allow you to debug, share and prototype plug-ins more quickly.\n\nIn-memory plug-ins come directly from the Python run-time and isn't dependent on a filesystem search, which means you can easily post a plug-in to someone else. Once registered, it will be processed like any other plug-in.\n\n``` python\nimport pyblish.api\n\nclass SelectPrototypeInstance(pyblish.api.Selector):\n    def process(self, context):\n        instance = context.create_instance(\"Prototype Test\")\n        instance.set_data(\"family\", \"prototype\")\n\npyblish.api.register_plugin(SelectPrototypeInstance)\n```\n\nThis can be done anytime prior to publishing, including whilst the GUI is open, which means you can do some pretty intense things to hunt down bugs.\n\n``` python\nimport pyblish.api\n\ndata = {}\n\n@pyblish.api.log\nclass MyPlugin(pyblish.api.Plugin):\n    def process(self):\n        data[\"key\"] = \"value\"\n\npyblish.api.register_plugin(MyPlugin)\n```\n\nAfter publishing, `data` will contain the key `key` with value `value`. This is an example of a plug-in reaching out into the current execution environment. Something **not possible** before.\n\n**Related functions**\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish/issues/140)\n- [pyblish.api.register_plugin](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish.api/wiki/register_plugin)\n- [pyblish.api.deregister_plugin](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish.api/wiki/deregister_plugin)\n- [pyblish.api.deregister_all_plugins](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish.api/wiki/deregister_all_plugins)\n- [pyblish.api.registered_plugins](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish.api/wiki/registered_plugins)\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### New Defaults for Families and Hosts\n\nThe attributes `families` and `hosts` now default to `*`, which means that they process everything in sight, unless you tell it not to.\n\nThis is different from how it was before, which was to process nothing, unless you told it to.\n\nThis has no effect on your current plug-ins, as you were obligated to always provide a family if you wanted it to process, but does mean it is a non-reversible change. So, fingers crossed you like it!\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Custom Test\n\nYou can now take control over when publishing is cancelled.\n\nCurrently, every plug-in is processed, unless the next plug-in is of an order above 2 (i.e. _not_ a Selector nor Validator) and no prior plug-in within the orders 1-2 (i.e. any Validator) have failed.\n\nThis is what that test looks like.\n\n``` python\ndef default_test(**vars):\n    if vars[\"nextOrder\"] >= 2:  # If validation is done\n        for order in vars[\"ordersWithError\"]:\n            if order < 2:  # Were there any error before validation?\n                return \"failed validation\"\n    return\n```\n\nThe test is run each time a new plug-in is about to process, and is given a dictionary `vars` which is always up to date with the most recent information.\n\nCurrently, the only two members of the dictionary is `nextOrder` and `ordersWithError`, but as need arises more will most likely be added.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### create_instance(name, **kwargs)\n\nYou can now create instances and assign it a family in one go.\n\n``` python\nimport pyblish.api\ncontext = pyblish.api.Context()\n\n# Before\ninstance = context.create_instance(name=\"MyInstance\")\ninstance.set_data(\"family\", \"myFamily\")\n\n# After\ninstance = context.create_instance(name=\"MyInstance\", family=\"myFamily\")\n```\n\nAnd condense some otherwise repeated code into a more minimal variant.\n\n``` python\nimport pyblish.api\ncontext = pyblish.api.Context()\n\n# Before\ninstance = context.create_instance(\"MyInstance\")\ninstance.set_data(\"family\", \"myFamily\")\ninstance.set_data(\"color\", \"blue\")\ninstance.set_data(\"age\", 35)\ninstance.set_data(\"height\", 1.90)\n\n# After\ninstance = context.create_instance(\n  name=\"MyInstance\",\n  family=\"myFamily\",\n  color=\"blue\",\n  age=35,\n  height=1.90)\n```\n\n**Related**\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish/issues/187)\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Unified Logic\n\nThe order in which to process plug-ins, and whether or not to cancel a publish after a failed validation was previously implemented in each user-facing interface. Such as `pyblish.util.publish()`, the [command-line interface](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish/wiki/Command-line-Interface) and [graphical user interface](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-qml/wiki).\n\nIn 1.1, logic has been centralised and is more likely to remain identical across interfaces.\n\n**Related**\n- [logic.py](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish/blob/master/pyblish/logic.py)\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Asset\n\nAs a preview, I've also included an _undocumented_ and _unsupported_ method of using the term `Asset` in place of `Instance`, as discussed [here](http://forums.pyblish.com/t/renaming-instance-to-asset/100).\n\nIt means you can give it a try and get a sense for whether or not it works for you. If it turns out to be a winner, it may potentially become the de-facto new standard of Pyblish.\n\nAn example, taken from the forum thread.\n\n``` python\nimport pyblish.api\n\nclass SelectCharacters(pyblish.api.Selector):\n  def process(self, context):\n    for objset in cmds.ls(type=\"objectSet\"):\n      name = cmds.getAttr(objset + \".name\")\n      asset = context.create_asset(name)\n      asset.set_data(\"family\", \"character\")\n\nclass ValidateColor(pyblish.api.Validator):\n  families = [\"character\"]\n  def process(self, asset):\n    assert asset.data(\"color\") == \"blue\", \"%s isn't blue\" % asset\n```\n\nThe same behaviour is replicated all across the board, including an alias for `Instance` through the API.\n\n``` python\n>>> import pyblish.api\n>>> assert pyblish.api.Instance == pyblish.api.Asset\n```\n\nUse with caution, expect it to vanish at any moment without warning.\n\nThat's it! Enjoy!\n"}
