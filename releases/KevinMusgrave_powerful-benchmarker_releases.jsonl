For example, if you have umap installed and register ```umap.UMAP``` under the ```\"visualizer\"``` type, then you can do:\r\n```\r\n--tester~APPLY~2 {visualizer: {UMAP: {}}}\r\n```\r\nPlots will be saved in a ```saved_plots``` folder per split. When evaluating an ensemble, the plots will be saved in ```meta_logs/saved_plots```\r\n\r\n- Added ability to aggregate over a specific split, rather than having it hard-coded to val. The config option is ```split_to_aggregate```:\r\n```yaml\r\naggregator:\r\n  MeanAggregator:\r\n    split_to_aggregate: val\r\n```\r\n\r\n- 0th model is saved as the \"best\" before training begins, so that there always exists a \"best\" model, in case the 0th model is never surpassed.\r\n\r\n- Update loss factory to be compatible with pytorch-metric-learning 0.9.92, so the nested objects (distances, reducers, weight regularizers, embedding regularizers, and weight init functions) can be specified in the config for the loss function.\r\n\r\n- Added ```api_parser``` config option, which is null by default. In this default setting, ```BaseAPIParser``` is used. If you use a custom trainer, it will try to use ```API<name_of_your_trainer>```, and if that doesn't exist, it will use ```BaseAPIParser```. If you set the ```api_parser``` option, then that will be used:\r\n```yaml\r\napi_parser:\r\n  your_custom_parser:\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Changed default folder locations in run.py. Before it was ```/content```, which wasn't a nice user experience for first time users.\r\n\r\n- Added ```log_data_to_tensorboard``` config option. It is True by default. Set it to False if you don't want to log data to tensorboard. This can be useful if your disk I/O is slow."}
