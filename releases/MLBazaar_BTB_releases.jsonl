This module provides everything\r\nneeded for the `tuning` process and comes with three new additions `Acquisition`, `Metamodel` and\r\n`Tunable`. Also there is an update to the `Hyperparamters` and `Tuners`. This changes are meant\r\nto help developers and contributors to easily develop, test and contribute new `Tuners`.\r\n\r\n### New API\r\n\r\nThere is a slightly new way of using `BTB` as the new `Tunable` class is introduced, that is meant\r\nto be the only required object to instantiate a `Tuner`. This `Tunable` class represents a\r\ncollection of `HyperParams` that need to be tuned as a whole, at once. Now, in order to create a\r\n`Tuner`, a `Tunable` instance must be created first with the `hyperparameters` of the\r\n`objective function`.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n* New `Hyperparameters` that allow an easier interaction for the final user.\r\n* New `Tunable` class that manages a collection of `Hyperparameters`.\r\n* New `Tuner` class that is a python mixin that requieres of `Acquisition` and `Metamodel` as\r\nparents. Also now works with a single `Tunable` object.\r\n* New `Acquisition` class, meant to implement an acquisition function to be inherit by a `Tuner`.\r\n* New `Metamodel` class, meant to implement everything that a certain `model` needs and be inherit\r\nby the `Tuner`.\r\n* Reorganization of the `selection` module to follow a similar `API` to `tuning`.\r\n\r\n### Resolved Issues\r\n\r\n* Issue #131: Reorganize the project structure.\r\n* Issue #133: Implement Tunable class to control a list of hyperparameters.\r\n* Issue #134: Implementation of Tuners for the new structure.\r\n* Issue #140: Reorganize selectors.\r\n"}
