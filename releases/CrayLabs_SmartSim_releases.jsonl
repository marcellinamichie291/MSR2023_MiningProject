This feature has been tested on a small number of platforms and we encourage users to provide feedback on its use.\r\n\r\nWe have also made improvements in a variety of areas: new utilities to load scripts and machine learning models into the database directly from SmartSim driver scripts and install-time choice to use either `KeyDB` or `Redis` for the Orchestrator. The `RunSettings` API is now more consistent across subclasses. Another key focus of this release was to aid new SmartSim users by including more extensive tutorials and improving the documentation.
