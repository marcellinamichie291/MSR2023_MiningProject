So the complicated code which supported it has been removed, rather than trying to update it to keep up with new features like phrase analysis.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- The versioning numbering scheme has been made more reasonable. This is now version 7.0.0 instead of 0.7.0, to reflect the fact that there have been many releases in active production use.\r\n- We now ensure that if the TimeFinder is running, it is informed about new beats received before any other registered beat listeners, so they can rely on it to provide the actual current beat number."}

We no longer crash when we encounter\r\n  such partial cues.\r\n- Fixes to the Beat Link and Crate Digger libraries allow them to work properly with new formats for data that rekordbox 6 sends. We may find more problems in the future, because testing with this new version has been limited, but it is already working much better than it did at first.\r\n- An update to Crate Digger avoids crashes when trying to parse track analysis files created with mal-formed vestigial waveform preview tags.\r\n- The interpretation of byte `0x37` in the CDJ status packet has been updated, which forced fixes of the `isDiscSlotEmpty()` and `getDiscTrackCount()` methods in `CdjStatus`.\r\n- Links in the JavaDoc now directly take you to the relevant sections of the new Antora documentation site that replaced the old PDF protocol analysis document.\r\n- Track Load packets now need to have an extra value to tell the recipient on which deck the track should be loaded, because the XDJ-XZ has two decks but only one network address on which to receive these commands. (Sadly for us, it refuses to load tracks from other players even when this byte is sent correctly, it only loads tracks from a rekordbox collection when rekordbox tells it to.)\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- Another bit has been explained in the main `CdjStatus` flags byte: we can now tell when a DJ has forced a player into degraded BPM-only sync mode (by nudging the jog wheel of a synced player).\r\n- We now know that beat grid entries also report the tempo of the track at that beat, so this is properly exposed in the API.\r\n- We now fully support the device number assignment phase of the Pro DJ Link protocol, so when Beat Link is connected to an ethernet port on a mixer that is assigned a dedicated channel number, it will use that device number, and we defend our device number once we have successully claimed it.\r\n\r\n### Deprecated\r\n\r\n- The classes and methods relating to creating and using metadata caches are no longer needed because we can reliably obtain metadata no matter how many CDJs are on the network.\r\n- The `getName` and `getNumber` methods in `DeviceAnnouncement` were inconsistent with the `getDeviceName` and `getDeviceNumber` naming convention used in the entire device update packet hierarchy."}

Track position detection is only possible with nexus and later hardware, because only they report beat numbers.\r\n- When the `VirtualCdj` is forced to shut down because of apparent network changes, it now also flushes the `DeviceFinder`\u2019s list of known DJ Link devices, because they are probably no longer reachable. This will allow for immediate recovery attempts by telling the `VirtualCdj` to restart itself (without this change, restarting it within ten seconds or so would fail because it would complain about being unable to communicate with the ghost devices on a no-longer reachable network, until they disappeared due to lack of recent packets).\r\n- The `crate-digger` library was updated to fix a misunderstanding of the structure of cue list entries which could crash the parser.\r\n- Our own parsing of cue list entries fetched using the `dbserver` protocol is now robust against missing color bytes, which also seems to happen in the wild.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- Error messages reported when parsing an ANLZ or EXT file fails now include the path to the file in the source media, to help find it for forensic analysis. This enabled the `crate-digger` fix mentioned above.\r\n- A flag on the DeviceUpdate class that indicates whether it seems to have been sent by a pre-nexus player (CDJ-900 or CDJ-2000).\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- No longer log a stack trace for the expected situation of a color waveform (or waveform preview) being unavailable. Also handle the case where it is reported available, but has zero size.\r\n- Because the XDJ-1000 seems to calculate the payload size value for its status packets incorrectly (subtracting the header size twice) we now only report that one time, to stop flooding the logs with warnings for each status packet received.\r\n"}

This seems to have been caused by the players not being quite ready to respond to the port number query right after booting, so we now try again a few times.\r\n- Some extended cue entries encountered by users were missing the color bytes, which prevented Crate Digger from parsing `EXT` files and accessing color waveforms. These values are now treated as optional.\r\n- Eliminated spurious warnings in the log for cue entries with rekordbox color code 0 which also had explicit green color values stored for nxs2 players.\r\n- Now builds properly under current JDKs, including Amazon Corretto 11 (which is a long-term support release). The minimum JDK for building is now Java 9, but the resulting build is still compatible back to Java 1.6. Building under Java 11 results in much nicer JavaDoc, with search support."}

It also implements a new interface that can be used by client objects to offer cached metadata to Beat Link (for example track cue lists that group metadata from multiple different media sources).\r\n- Track comments and dates added are just plain strings, not searchable items, so the API has been changed to reflect this.\r\n- `WaveformPreviewComponent` and `WaveformDetailComponent` have been generalized to support tracking multiple simultaneous playback positions, so they can be used in the context of a Beat Link Trigger\r\n  show file, where a track can be loaded and even playing on multiple players at once.\r\n- It is now possible to construct a fully-functional `WaveformPreviewComponent` or `WaveformDetailComponent` even if you don\u2019t have access to actual `TrackMetadata` objects, as long as you pass them the few individual pieces of information they need. Again, this supports the needs of the new Beat Link Trigger show interface.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- We now can use [Crate Digger](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/crate-digger#crate-digger) to reliably obtain metadata even when there are four players on the network, and we are using player number 5.\r\n- We can now retrieve and display the full-color waveforms used by nxs2 players and rekordbox, and prefer them when available. This can be turned off through a `WaveformFinder` property.\r\n- When going online, the `VirtualCdj` now reports information about the chosen network interface to help with troubleshooting problematic network environments.\r\n- There is a new interface, `TrackPositionBeatListener`, that can be registered with the `TimeFinder` in order to learn about new beats as soon as they happen, along with the actual beat number within the track represented by the beat (which is missing from the raw beat packet available through the `BeatFinder`).\r\n- The `TimeFinder` takes advantage of track metadata, (when it is available) to detect when the DJ has jumped to a cue, or when a track has loaded with auto-cue to a memory point, so it can more accurately infer where the player has stopped.\r\n- `MenuLoader` supports loading several more menu types from the dbserver.\r\n- We can offer track years as part of the metadata when rekordbox is indexing that.\r\n- When disconnecting from a player\u2019s dbserver, we politely send a teardown message and let it close the connection from its side.\r\n- A few new methods that can help troubleshoot problematic network topologies are available. Beat Link Trigger uses them to provide better help at startup.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- A mistake in the `TimeFinder` which could trap the `VirtualCdj` packet delivery thread in an infinite loop, which would then cause client applications to lose touch with what was happening on the players, with no recourse except going offline and back online (and even this would gradually waste more and more CPU time on each occurrence). Thanks to [@Kevinnns](https://github.com/Kevinnns) for the thread dumps which helped finally find this!\r\n- The code that was supposed to notice computers running rekordbox and report their media collections as being available on the network had always been broken, but was easy enough to fix. Now Beat Link Trigger can tell players to load tracks from rekordbox and rekordbox mobile.\r\n- The various metadata finders were supposed to report the loss of associated metadata when a player disappeared from the network, but they were not doing so.\r\n- At some point (possibly when adding the ability to show multiple player locations in a waveform) the memory point and hot cue markers stopped being displayed in the waveform preview. They have been restored.\r\n- Cue Lists were not being sorted into the correct order when they were loaded from Crate Digger. Now they are sorted regardless of how we obtain them.\r\n- The colors used for playback position markers were inconsistent between the waveform preview and waveform detail (one used red when the other used white for playing/stopped). Now they both use the constants defined in the WaveformDetailComponent, which also adds a bit of transparency to the preview markers.\r\n- It turns out that rekordbox mobile does not report meaningful values for its media name or creation date, so we no longer attempt to parse them.\r\n- It seems rekordbox sometimes sends mixer status packets with a different subtype structure which was causing us to log warnings about a length mismatch. We now properly recognize this packet subtype."}

This affected time-remaining calculations too.\r\n- Now assembles entire dbserver messages into a buffer to write them to the network as a single operation, avoiding the chance of them being split into multiple packets, because Windows rekordbox can't handle when they are.\r\n- Removed a potential source of crashes in the waveform rendering code.\r\n- Improved the clarity of an exception thrown when trying to ask for metadata from a player for which we did not find a db server port.\r\n- Improved protection against problems that can occur when delivering events (status updates, beats, etc.) to registered listeners; previously we were only catching exceptions, but some kinds of problems in the listener classes would lead to other kinds of throwables, which could kill our event delivery loops.\r\n- The _count_ parameter is now passed in menu render requests in a way that is more consistent with the way CDJs do it, although this has not seemed to cause any problems.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- We no longer simply reject packets with unexpected lengths; if they are longer than the minimum value we expect, we try to process them after logging a warning. If they are too short, we just log the warning.\r\n- More use of ByteBuffers to efficiently assemble and compare packets.\r\n- The `TRACK_LIST_REQ` message type has been renamed `TRACK_MENU_REQ` to fit in with the large number of other menus that have been added."}

API compatibility was not maintained with\r\n  previous releases.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- Many more kinds of information can be retrieved from players, and\r\n  the classes and API documentation have been enriched to reflect our\r\n  deepening understanding of the protocol.\r\n- Metadata cache files can be created by downloading either entire\r\n  collections or individual playlists from players on the network, and\r\n  then attached for use in environments (such as busy shows with four\r\n  physical players) where metadata queries are not reliable.\r\n- Metadata cache files can be monitored for automatic attachment to\r\n  player ports when media that matches the cache is mounted by the\r\n  player.\r\n- New listener interfaces to provide information about changes to the\r\n  available metadata caches, as well as changes to metadata about\r\n  tracks loaded in players on the network.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- The approach to concurrency was examined carefully, and almost all\r\n  synchronized methods were eliminated in favor of newer concurrent\r\n  classes for improved performance and safety.\r\n- When the last device disappears from the Pro DJ Link network, we\r\n  clear the DeviceFinder's notion of when we first saw one, so that\r\n  the VirtualCDJ's device-number conflict-avoidance code can work\r\n  properly when we later encounter a new network.\r\n"}
