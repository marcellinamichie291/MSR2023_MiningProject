I see this as an indication both that we're fulfilling a wide-spread need and that we've created an environment that encourages external contribution.  I encourage anyone else interested in contributing to join this list over the coming months.\n\nNext, I'd like to recognize the lead of [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io) Stephane Maldini, for his tireless efforts to help us deliver an incredible reactive API.  When we took the decision to head in this direction, Stephane stepped up to teach the entire team the principles behind reactive programming.  This effort was non-trivial, entailing hundreds of hours on [Screenhero](https://screenhero.com) often until after one in the morning for him.  The last year has easily been the greatest example of two projects evolving together, that I have ever experienced.  The amount of improvement Reactor and the Java Client have driven in each other cannot be overestimated.\n\nFinally I'd like to thank the teams that started building on the Java Client, long before it was production ready.  Projects like [Spring Cloud Data Flow](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow) and [Spring Cloud Spinnaker](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-spinnaker) have been invaluable tools for driving usability and bug fixes.\n\nAnd now onto the release!\n\n---\n\nThis release was a [complete re-write](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client/commit/dc8f8d5c8370de223992a0e4a024d5cff082a682) of the Java Client with a focus on:\n- two cleanly delineated APIs; a `-client` API mapping to the REST calls and an `-operations` API mapping to CLI\n- implementing every single REST call exposed by all Cloud Foundry components (more than 500 individual URIs across 4 components)\n- an airtight separation between APIs and implementation; a Reactor-based default is provided, and alternate implementations are possible\n- a reactive API based on Project Reactor and interoperable with any [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org)-compatible library\n\n_For more detail on these goals, please see the [2.0.0.M1 Release Notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client/releases/tag/v2.0.0.M1)_\n\nFor detailed information on how to use the client, the [README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client/tree/v2.0.0.RELEASE) is the best place to start.  Javadocs for the library can be found at [`cloudfoundry-client`](http://cloudfoundry.github.io/cf-java-client/api/latest-release/cloudfoundry-client), [`cloudfoundry-client-reactor`](http://cloudfoundry.github.io/cf-java-client/api/latest-release/cloudfoundry-client-reactor), [`cloudfoundry-operations`](http://cloudfoundry.github.io/cf-java-client/api/latest-release/cloudfoundry-operations), and [`cloudfoundry-util`](http://cloudfoundry.github.io/cf-java-client/api/latest-release/cloudfoundry-util).  Since usage requires a fair bit of knowledge about the workings of the Cloud Foundry APIs themselves, check out the docs for the [Cloud Controller V2](http://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/latest-release), [V3](http://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/version/release-candidate/index.html), [Doppler](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/tree/develop/src/trafficcontroller#endpoints), and the [UAA](http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/uaa).\n\nWhile the Java Client implements a great many of the Cloud Foundry APIs we didn't manage to complete them _all_.  By our count we're about 80% the way through and have delivered all of the commonly used endpoints.  Over the coming months we'll be continuing to deliver the missing implementations until everything is complete.  Beyond that, we're committed to keeping the library up to date with Cloud Foundry's evolving API.\n\nWe welcome all feedback from the community and look forward to seeing you [open issues](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client/issues) and [submit pull requests](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client/pulls).  If you're looking for help and discussion we're lurking in the [Cloud Foundry Slack](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/java-client/) during European and North American working hours.\n\nWe hope that the new Java Client is useful for everyone and can't wait to see what you build with it.\n"}

Towards the end of last year, my team started working on the project with the goal of making it a piece of software that we were not only proud of, but that we could build towards the future with.  With that in mind, I\u2019m exceedingly pleased to announce our 2.0.0.M1 release.\n\nWe\u2019ve taken the opportunity of this major release to reset what the project is:\n-  What was a once hodgepodge of Java APIs both mapping directly onto the REST APIs and onto higher-level abstractions is now two clearly delineated APIs.  We expose a `-client` API mapping to the REST calls and an `-operations` API mapping to the higher-level abstractions that roughly match the CLI.\n- What once was an implementation of a subset of the Cloud Foundry APIs is now a target of implementing every single REST call exposed by any Cloud Foundry component (nearly 500 individual URIs across 4 components)\n- What was once a co-mingled interface and Spring-based implementation is now an airtight separation between the two allowing alternate implementations (addressing one of the largest complaints about the previous generation)\n- Finally, we\u2019ve chosen to make the API reactive, building on top of Project Reactor, but interoperable with any Reactive Streams compatible library\n\nObviously, the biggest change in this list is the move to a reactive API.  This decision was not take lightly.  In fact our original V2 implementation was imperative following the pattern of the V1 effort.  However, after consulting with both internal and external users, we found that many teams were viewing \u201cblocking\u201d APIs as a serious issue as they implemented their high-performance micro-service architectures.  \n\nAs an example, we worked very deeply with a team right at the beginning as they were creating a new Cloud Foundry Routing Service.  Since each HTTP request into their system went though this service, performance was a primary concern and they were finding that the blocking bit of their implementation (Java Client V1) was the biggest hit for them.  We\u2019ve mitigated a lot of the performance bottle neck with what we\u2019ve got today, but for M2 we\u2019re planning on removing that last blocking component completely and moving to a full non-blocking network stack.  This isn\u2019t an isolated use case either, we\u2019ve been seeing a lot of this theme; micro-service architectures require throughput that can\u2019t be achieved without either a non-blocking stack or \u201cmassive\u201d horizontal scaling.  Most companies would prefer the former simply due to cost.\n\nAs a general rule you can make a reactive api blocking (just tack `.get()` onto the end of any Reactor flow) but cannot make a blocking API non-blocking (see the insanity we do to fake it, with non-optimal results, on [RestTemplate](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client/blob/c35c20463fab0e7730bf807af9e84ac186cdb3c2/cloudfoundry-client-spring/src/main/lombok/org/cloudfoundry/spring/util/AbstractSpringOperations.java#L73-L127) today).  So since we had a strong requirement to support this non-blocking design we figured that going reactive-first was the most flexible design we could choose.\n\nIf you want to get started with this new version, I\u2019m sad to say that we\u2019re a bit lacking in the \u201con boarding experience\u201d at the moment.  We don\u2019t have examples or a user-guide, but the repository\u2019s [README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client) is a good place to start.  As you progress deeper into using the client, you can probably piece something together from the [Javadocs](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client#documentation) and the [Cloud Foundry API](https://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/latest-release/) documentation.  Finally, the best examples are found in our [integration tests](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client/blob/master/integration-test/src/test/java/org/cloudfoundry/operations/RoutesTest.java#L114-L135).  Improving this experience is something we\u2019re quite sensitive to, so you can expect significant improvements here.\n\nThe reason that we\u2019re laying this foundation is you.  We\u2019re already seeing customers adopting (and contributing back to!) the project, but we\u2019ve really done it to accelerate the entire Cloud Foundry ecosystem.  If you need to interact with Cloud Foundry, I want you to be using the Java Client.  If you find that it\u2019s not the best way for you to get your work done, I want you to tell me, loudly and often.  We\u2019re also excited about being in the vanguard of reactive APIs within the Java ecosystem.  Having recently experienced it, I\u2019m sure that this transition will not be trivial, but I am sure that it\u2019ll be worthwhile.\n\nA special thanks goes out to Scott Fredrick (Pivotal) for nursing the project along far enough for us to take over, Benjamin Einaudi (Orange Telecom) for his constant submissions, and of course Chris Frost (Pivotal), Glyn Normington (Pivotal), Paul Harris (Pivotal), and Steve Powell (Pivotal) for doing so much of the hard work.\n"}
