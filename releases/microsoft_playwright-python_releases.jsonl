Network Replay\r\n\r\nNow you can record network traffic into a HAR file and re-use this traffic in your tests.\r\n\r\nTo record network into HAR file:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpx playwright open --save-har=github.har.zip https://github.com/microsoft\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can record HAR programmatically:\r\n\r\n```python sync\r\ncontext = browser.new_context(record_har_path=\"github.har.zip\")\r\n# ... do stuff ...\r\ncontext.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse the new methods [`method: Page.route_from_har`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-route-from-har) or [`method: BrowserContext.route_from_har`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-route-from-har) to serve matching responses from the [HAR](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/) file:\r\n\r\n```python sync\r\ncontext.route_from_har(\"github.har.zip\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nRead more in [our documentation](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/network#record-and-replay-requests).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Advanced Routing\r\n\r\nYou can now use [`method: Route.fallback`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-route#route-fallback) to defer routing to other handlers.\r\n\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n\r\n```python sync\r\n# Remove a header from all requests\r\ndef remove_header_handler(route: Route) -> None:\r\n    headers = route.request.all_headers()\r\n    if \"if-none-match\" in headers:\r\n        del headers[\"if-none-match\"]\r\n    route.fallback(headers=headers)\r\n\r\npage.route(\"**/*\", remove_header_handler)\r\n\r\n# Abort all images\r\ndef abort_images_handler(route: Route) -> None:\r\n    if route.request.resource_type == \"image\":\r\n        route.abort()\r\n    else:\r\n        route.fallback()\r\n\r\npage.route(\"**/*\", abort_images_handler)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the new methods [`method: Page.route_from_har`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-route-from-har) or [`method: BrowserContext.route_from_har`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-route-from-har) also participate in routing and could be deferred to.\r\n\r\n### Web-First Assertions Update\r\n\r\n* New method [`method: LocatorAssertions.to_have_values`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/test-assertions#locator-assertions-to-have-values) that asserts all selected values of `<select multiple>` element.\r\n* Methods [`method: LocatorAssertions.to_contain_text`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/test-assertions#locator-assertions-to-contain-text) and [`method: LocatorAssertions.to_have_text`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/test-assertions#locator-assertions-to-have-text) now accept `ignore_case` option.\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n* If there's a service worker that's in your way, you can now easily disable it with a new context option `service_workers`:\r\n\r\n  ```python sync\r\n  context = browser.new_context(service_workers=\"block\")\r\n  page = context.new_page()\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Using `.zip` path for `recordHar` context option automatically zips the resulting HAR:\r\n\r\n  ```python sync\r\n  context = browser.new_context(record_har_path=\"github.har.zip\")\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* If you intend to edit HAR by hand, consider using the `\"minimal\"` HAR recording mode\r\n  that only records information that is essential for replaying:\r\n\r\n  ```python sync\r\n  context = browser.new_context(record_har_mode=\"minimal\", record_har_path=\"har.har\")\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Playwright now runs on Ubuntu 22 amd64 and Ubuntu 22 arm64.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/playwright-python/releases/71028453/reactions", "total_count": 9, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":
