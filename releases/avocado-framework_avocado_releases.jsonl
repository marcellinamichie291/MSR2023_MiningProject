It's built on the Job\r\n  API and ``nrunner`` architecture.\r\n\r\n* Test writers can now access a test's status while the ``tearDown``\r\n  method is being run.\r\n\r\n* Result plugins such as ``json`` and ``xunit`` now contain more accurate\r\n  values reflecting Avocado's concepts of a test's ID and name.\r\n\r\n* Support was added for ``Coverage.py`` when running\r\n  ``avocado-instrumented`` tests (currently limited to the\r\n  ``ProcessSpawner``).\r\n\r\n* By setting the ``spawner.podman.avocado_spawner_egg`` configuration\r\n  users can now control the exact Avocado package that will be\r\n  automatically deployed within Podman containers.\r\n\r\nBug Fixes\r\n=========\r\n\r\n* A default value was added to the Spawner's attribute that tracks the\r\n  job's output directory, avoiding ``NoneType`` errors when it's not\r\n  explicitly set.\r\n\r\n* A crash when using the Podman spawner, after changes to the output\r\n  dir handling, has fixed.\r\n\r\nMisc Changes\r\n============\r\n\r\n* ``RuntimeTask`` instances are now comparable, and should now be\r\n  unique when representing requirements, preventing having duplicates.\r\n\r\n* The order of the ``RuntimeTask``s are now defined in a dependency\r\n  graph, in accordance with BluePrint 004.\r\n\r\nInternal Changes\r\n================\r\n\r\n* ``setup.py test`` now returns a non-zero error code when failures\r\n  occur.\r\n\r\n* RHEL 9 Beta has been added to some CI checks, and Ubuntu has been\r\n  updated from 18.04 to 21.10.\r\n\r\n* Pylint was updated to 2.12.2, along with many changes to conform to\r\n  the checks performed by that version.\r\n\r\n* Many parts of Avocado, including most \"optional plugins\", are now\r\n  PEP420 compliant.\r\n\r\n* Improvements to the contributor guide.\r\n\r\n* CI checks running on Cirrus-CI have been moved to GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\n* Packit builds have been added for CentOS Stream 8 and 9.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor more information, please check out the complete\r\n`Avocado changelog\r\n<https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/compare/94.0...95.0>`_.\r\n"}

available!\r\n\r\nRelease documentation: http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.io/en/94.0/\r\n\r\nUsers/Test Writers\r\n==================\r\n\r\n* The Podman Spawner now deploys Avocado inside a container using\r\n  Python eggs.  This is a significant change from previous versions in\r\n  the sense that all test types supported by Avocado's ``nrunner``\r\n  architecture in the default installation are now supported on a\r\n  container (this includes ``avocado-instrumented``, ``tap``, etc).\r\n\r\n* A results plugin for `Beaker <https://beaker-project.org>`_ is\r\n  now available and works out of the box without any manual\r\n  configuration needed.\r\n\r\n* The ``AVOCADO_VERSION`` and ``AVOCADO_TEST_WORKDIR`` are now\r\n  available to ``exec-test`` tests run under the ``nrunner``\r\n  architecture.\r\n\r\n* ``nrunner`` task identifiers can now be configured as a format\r\n  string that utilizes the attributes of the runnable.  This allows\r\n  users to define how test results will be named and presented.\r\n\r\n* The ``--output-check-record`` has been dropped for the legacy\r\n  runner.  A similar feature is planned to be added to the ``nrunner``\r\n  architecture.\r\n\r\nBug Fixes\r\n=========\r\n\r\n* Objects that could not be serialized as JSON were causing crashes\r\n  during job runs.\r\n\r\nUtility APIs\r\n============\r\n\r\n* mod:`avocado.utils.network` removed deprecated modules and methods.\r\n\r\n* mod:`avocado.utils.vmimage` now uses https://cloud.debian.org for\r\n  obtaining Debian Cloud images.\r\n\r\nMisc Changes\r\n============\r\n\r\n* A Blue Print for a new architecture responsible for handling the\r\n  tasks dependencies has been approved\r\n\r\n* More work towards the elimination of root logger usage\r\n\r\nInternal Changes\r\n================\r\n\r\n* Spanwers now better cooperate with runners with regards to the\r\n  output directory, avoiding duplicate directories and unnecessary\r\n  data copies.\r\n\r\n* CodeCoverage CI jobs will run only once (on Python 3.10)\r\n\r\n* The ``selftests/check.py`` script now allows for the inclusion\r\n  (``--select``) or exclusion (``--skip``) of major test groups to be\r\n  run\r\n\r\n* The import style used throughout Avocado has switched from relative\r\n  to absolute imports\r\n"}

available!\r\n\r\nRelease documentation: `Avocado 93.0\r\n<http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.io/en/93.0/>`_\r\n\r\nUsers/Test Writers\r\n==================\r\n\r\n* The ``dict_variants`` plugin now allows the configuration of the\r\n  keys that will determine the variant ID.\r\n\r\n* The legacy runner (``--test-runner=runner``) is being dismantled.\r\n  In this release, the following features have removed:\r\n\r\n  1. The ``PYTHON_UNITTEST`` test type\r\n\r\n  2. The ``--external-runner`` feature and its underlying test type.\r\n\r\n  3. The ``ROBOT`` test type\r\n\r\n  4. The ``GOLANG`` test type\r\n\r\n* When using the Job API, test suites can be enabled or disabled.\r\n  Having a disabled test suite means it won't be executed.  This eases\r\n  the creation of custom jobs where the user can choose to run a\r\n  subset of suites.\r\n\r\nBug Fixes\r\n=========\r\n\r\n* The :mod:`avocado.core.job` code was using the root logger, instead\r\n  of the logger at the ``avocado`` namespace.\r\n\r\n* The automatic status server was very prone to failures due to\r\n  ``AF_UNIX``'s limitation on the length of paths, because it was\r\n  created inside a job's result directory.  Now it's created on the\r\n  base system temporary directory, which makes it very hard to exceed\r\n  the path length limit.\r\n\r\n* The :mod:`avocado.utils.vmimage` library received the following\r\n  improvements:\r\n\r\n  1. Ubuntu's provider now properly handles the version number when it\r\n     compares versions with trailing zeroes.\r\n\r\n  2. Ubuntu and OpenSUSE providers can now fetch the best (latest)\r\n     version available when no version is given.\r\n\r\n  3. OpenSUSE provider will now use OpenStack images starting from\r\n     version 15.3, due to the other images having been discontinued.\r\n\r\n* The ``variants.json`` file, saved at the ``jobdata`` directory\r\n  inside a job's result directory, now takes into consideration the\r\n  possible multiple suites in a job.  The files are now named after\r\n  named with a numeric suffix and, if a name was given to the suite, a\r\n  name suffix as well.\r\n\r\n* The serialization of the job configuration file, also saved in the\r\n  ``jobdata`` directory, has been updated to support ``set`` data\r\n  types.\r\n\r\n* ``avocado replay`` executions with a ``--show`` (which takes a set\r\n  of builtin loggers) now work properly due to the previous fix.\r\n\r\n* Various fixes to the ``runnable-run`` interface behavior of all\r\n  shipped runners (detected as part of an improvement in functional\r\n  test coverage).\r\n\r\n* When using the Job API, some code paths would still resort to using\r\n  the legacy runner.\r\n\r\n* ``nrunner`` based jobs (the default) can now run from Python egg\r\n  based deployments (meaning zero installation steps are required).\r\n\r\n* The ``resultsdb`` plugin is now pinned to a known working version\r\n  due to a broken release.\r\n\r\n* Test parameters given with the command line argument ``-p`` are now\r\n  internally converted into variants values.  This fixes the issue\r\n  with those parameters not being displayed in the ``results.html``\r\n  files.\r\n\r\nUtility APIs\r\n============\r\n\r\n* The new method\r\n  `avocado.utils.network.interfaces.NetworkInterface.is_bond` that\r\n  allows users to check if a given interface is a bonding device.\r\n\r\nMisc Changes\r\n============\r\n\r\n* A few portability improvements for macOS systems.\r\n\r\n* Misc documentation improvements.\r\n\r\nInternal Changes\r\n================\r\n\r\n* The RPM packages can now be built without the execution of tests.\r\n\r\n* The spawner plugin interface now define two different types of\r\n  implementations, with the new one being a spawner that is capable of\r\n  deploying itself to the environments that will run the tasks.\r\n\r\n* Avocado is now also being tested under Python 3.11.\r\n\r\n* Various CI improvements.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/avocado-framework/avocado/releases/53594791/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

Previously\r\n  only the first class imported in such a statement was properly\r\n  processed.\r\n\r\n* ``avocado run`` will now create test suites without an automatic\r\n  (and usually very verbose) name, but instead without a name, given\r\n  that there will be only one suite on such jobs.  This restores\r\n  the ``avocado run`` behavior users expected and are used to.\r\n\r\n* Hint files are now being respected again, this time within the\r\n  context of test suite creation.\r\n\r\n* Filtering by tags is now working properly when using the resolver,\r\n  that is, when using ``avocado list --resolver -t $tag --\r\n  $reference``.\r\n\r\n* Test suites now properly respect the configuration given to them, as\r\n  opposed to using a configuration composed by the default registered\r\n  option values.\r\n\r\n* Fixed the \"elapsed time\" produced by the ``avocado-instrumented``\r\n  nrunner runner (that is, ``avocado-runner-avocado-instrumented``).\r\n\r\n* ``avocado --verbose list --resolver -- $reference`` has reinstated\r\n  the presentation of failed resolution information, which is useful\r\n  for understanding why a test reference was not resolved into a test.\r\n\r\n* The \"legacy replay plugin\", that is, ``avocado run --replay``, can\r\n  now replay a subset of tests based on their status.\r\n\r\n* The ``avocado diff`` command won't crash anymore if given\r\n  ``sysinfo`` files with binary content.  It will log the issue, and\r\n  not attempt to present binary differences.\r\n\r\n* The HTML report generated by ``avocado diff`` now runs properly\r\n  and won't crash.\r\n\r\n* The asset fetcher plugin won't crash anymore due to differences in\r\n  the AST based node attributes.\r\n\r\n* :class:`avocado.utils.process.FDDrainer` now properly respects the\r\n  presence and absence of newlines produced when running new processes\r\n  via :func:`avocado.utils.process.run` and friends.  This also fixes\r\n  tests that relied on the \"output check\" feature because of missing\r\n  newlines.\r\n\r\n* The ``nrunner`` plugin will now always display test status in the\r\n  most natural order, that is, ``STARTED`` before ``PASS`` or\r\n  ``FAIL``.\r\n\r\n* The ``nrunner`` plugin will now properly set the job status in case\r\n  of test failures, resulting in the job (and ``avocado run``) exit\r\n  status to properly signal failures.\r\n\r\n* A vast documentation review was performed, with many fixes and\r\n  improvements.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please check out the complete\r\nAvocado changelog: https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/compare/81.0...82.0\r\n"}

This should make the overall test execution more\r\n  reliable, and give better test execution times as the download\r\n  time will be excluded.  Users can also manually execute the\r\n  ``avocado assets`` command to manually fetch assets from tests.\r\n\r\n* The still experimental \"N(ext) Runner\" support for Avocado\r\n  Instrumented tests is more complete and supports tag filtering and\r\n  passing tags to the tests.\r\n\r\n* A new architecture for \"finding\" tests has been introduced as an\r\n  alternative to the :mod:`avocado.core.loader` code.  It's based\r\n  around the :mod:`avocado.core.resolver`, and it's currently used in\r\n  the still experimental \"N(ext) Runner\".  It currently supports tests\r\n  of the following types: ``avocado-instrumented``, ``exec-test``,\r\n  ``glib``, ``golang``, ``python-unittest`` and ``robot``.  You can\r\n  experiment it by running ``avocado nlist``, similarly to how ``avocado\r\n  list`` is used.\r\n\r\n* Avocado ``sysinfo`` feature file will now work out of the box on\r\n  ``pip`` based installations.  Previously, it would require\r\n  configuration files tweaks to adjust installation paths.\r\n\r\n* A massive documentation overhaul, now designed around guides to\r\n  different target audiences.  The \"User's Guide\", \"Test Writer's\r\n  Guide\" and \"Contributor's Guide\" can be easily found as first lever\r\n  sections contain curated content for those audiences.\r\n\r\nBug Fixes\r\n=========\r\n\r\n* Content supposed to be UI only could leak into TAP files, making\r\n  them invalid.\r\n\r\n* Avocado's ``sysinfo`` feature will now run commands without a\r\n  shell, resulting in more proper captured output, without shell\r\n  related content.\r\n\r\n* :func:`avocado.utils.process.SubProcess.send_signal` will now send a\r\n  signal to itself correctly even when using ``sudo`` mode.\r\n\r\nUtility APIs\r\n============\r\n\r\n* The :mod:`avocado.utils.vmimage` library now allows a user to\r\n  define the ``qemu-img`` binary that will be used for creating\r\n  snapshot images via the :data:`avocado.utils.vmimage.QEMU_IMG`\r\n  variable.\r\n\r\n* The :mod:`avocado.utils.configure_network` module introduced\r\n  a number of utilities, including MTU configuration support,\r\n  a method for validating network among peers, IPv6 support, etc.\r\n\r\n* The :func:`avocado.utils.configure_network.set_ip` function now\r\n  supports different interface types through a ``interface_type``\r\n  parameter, while still defaulting to ``Ethernet``.\r\n\r\nInternal Changes\r\n================\r\n\r\n* Package support for Enterprise Linux 8.\r\n\r\n* Increased CI coverage, having tests now run on four different\r\n  hardware architectures: amd64 (x86_64), arm64 (aarch64), ppc64le and\r\n  s390x.\r\n\r\n* Packit support adding extended CI coverage, with RPM packages being\r\n  built for Pull Requests and results shown on GitHub.\r\n\r\n* Pylint checks for w0703 were enabled.\r\n\r\n* Runners, such as the remote runner, vm runner, docker runner, and\r\n  the default local runner now conform to a \"runner\" interface and\r\n  can be seen as proper plugins with ``avocado plugins``.\r\n\r\n* Avocado's configuration parser will now treat values with relative\r\n  paths as a special value, and evaluate their content in relation\r\n  to the Python's distribution directory where Avocado is installed.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please check out the complete\r\n`Avocado changelog\r\n<https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/compare/72.0...73.0>`_.\r\n"}

This means that it\r\n  won't require extra packages, and should be easier to deploy on\r\n  containers, embedded systems, etc.  Optional plugins may have\r\n  additional requirements.\r\n\r\n* A new and still experimental test runner implementation, known as\r\n  \"N(ext) Runner\" has been introduced.  It brings a number of\r\n  different concepts, increasing the decoupling between a test (and\r\n  its runner) and the job.  For more information, please refer to\r\n  :ref:`the early documentation <nrunner>`.\r\n\r\n* The new :func:`avocado.cancel_on` decorator has been added to the\r\n  Test APIs, allowing you to define the conditions for a test to be\r\n  considered canceled.  See one example :ref:`here\r\n  <turning_errors_into_cancels>`.\r\n\r\n* The ``glib`` plugin got a configuration option its safe/unsafe\r\n  operation, that is, whether it will execute binaries in an attempt to\r\n  find the whole list of tests.  Look for the ``glib.conf`` shipped\r\n  with the plugin to enable the unsafe mode.\r\n\r\n* Avocado can now use tags inside Python Unittests, and not only on\r\n  its own Instrumented tests.  It's expected that other forms or\r\n  providing tags for other types of tests will also be introduced in\r\n  the near future.\r\n\r\n* The HTML report will now show, as a handy pop-up, the contents of the\r\n  test whiteboard.  If you set, say, performance metrics there, you'll\r\n  able to see straight from the report.\r\n\r\n* The HTML report now has filtering support by test status, and can\r\n  show all records in the table.\r\n\r\n* The :mod:`avocado.utils.runtime` module, a badly designed mechanism\r\n  for sharing Avocado runtime settings with the utility libraries, has\r\n  been removed.\r\n\r\n* The test runner feature that would allow binaries to be run\r\n  transparently inside GDB was removed.  The reason for dropping such\r\n  a feature have to do with how it limits the test runner to run one\r\n  test at a time, and the use of the :mod:`avocado.utils.runtime`\r\n  mechanism, also removed.\r\n\r\n* Initial examples for writing custom jobs, using the so called Job\r\n  API, have been added to ``examples/jobs``.  These APIs are still\r\n  non-public (under core), but they're supposed to become public\r\n  and supported soon.\r\n\r\n* By means of a new plugin (``merge_files``, of type ``job.prepost``),\r\n  when using the :ref:`output check record <output_check_record>`\r\n  features, duplicate files created by different tests/variants will\r\n  be consolidated into unique files.\r\n\r\nBug Fixes\r\n=========\r\n\r\n* The HTML plugin now correctly shows the date for tests that were\r\n  never executed because of interrupted jobs.\r\n\r\n* A temporarily workaround for a stack overflow problem in Python 3.7\r\n  has been addressed.\r\n\r\n* The pict plugin (a varianter implementaion) now properly yields the\r\n  variants paths as a list.\r\n\r\n* A Python 3 related fix to mod:`avocado.utils.software_manager`, that\r\n  was using Python 2 ``next`` on ``get_source``.\r\n\r\n* A Python 3 related fix to the docker plugin, that wasn't caught\r\n  earlier.\r\n\r\nUtility APIs\r\n============\r\n\r\n* :mod:`avocado.utils.partition` now allows ``mkfs`` and ``mount``\r\n  flags to be set.\r\n\r\n* :func:`avocado.utils.cpu.get_cpu_vendor_name` now returns the CPU\r\n  vendor name for POWER9.\r\n\r\n* :mod:`avocado.utils.asset` now allows a given location, as well as a\r\n  list, to be given, simplifying the most common use case.\r\n\r\n* :meth:`avocado.utils.process.SubProcess.stop` now supports setting\r\n  a timeout.  Please refer to the documentation for the important\r\n  details on its behavior.\r\n\r\n* :mod:`avocado.utils.memory` now properly handles hugepages for POWER\r\n  platform.\r\n\r\nInternal Changes\r\n================\r\n\r\n* Removal of the ``stevedore`` library dependency (previously used for\r\n  the dispatcher/plugins infrastructure).\r\n\r\n* ``make check`` now runs selftests using the experimental N(ext)\r\n  Runner.\r\n\r\n* Formal support for Python 3.7, which is now on our CI checks,\r\n  documentation and module information.\r\n\r\n* The Yaml to Mux plugin now uses a safe version of the Yaml loader,\r\n  so that the execution of arbitrary Python code from Yaml input is\r\n  now no longer possible.\r\n\r\n* Codecov coverage reports for have been enabled for Avocado, and\r\n  can be seen on every pull request.\r\n\r\n* New tests have been added to many of the optional plugins.\r\n\r\n* Various pylint compliance improvements, including w0231, w0235,\r\n  w0706, w0715 and w0221.\r\n\r\n* Avocado's selftests now use tempfile.TemporaryDirectory instead of\r\n  mkdtemp and shutil.rmtree.\r\n\r\n* :class:`avocado.core.job.Job` instantiation now takes a ``config``\r\n  dictionary parameter, instead of a ``argparse.Namespace`` instance,\r\n  and keeps it in a ``config`` attribute.\r\n\r\n* :class:`avocado.core.job.Job` instances don't have a ``references``\r\n  attribute anymore.

Now, in addition to\n  running tests on a (libvirt based) Virtual Machine or on a remote host,\n  you can now run tests in transient Docker containers.  The usage is as\n  simple as::\n  \n    $ avocado run mytests.py --docker ldoktor/fedora-avocado\n  \n  The container will be started, using `ldoktor/fedora-avocado` as\n  the image.  This image contains a Fedora based system with Avocado\n  already installed, and it's provided at the official Docker hub.\n- Introduction of the \"Fail Fast\" feature.\n  \n  By running a job with the `--failfast` flag, the job will be\n  interrupted after the very first test failure.  If your job only\n  makes sense if it's a complete PASS, this feature can save you a lot\n  of time.\n- Avocado supports replaying previous jobs, selected by using their\n  Job IDs.  Now, it's also possible to use the special keyword\n  `latest`, which will cause Avocado to rerun the very last job.\n- Python's standard signal handling is restored for SIGPIPE, and thus\n  for all tests running on Avocado.\n  \n  In previous releases, Avocado introduced a change that set the\n  default handler to SIGPIPE, which caused the application to be\n  terminated.  This seemed to be the right approach when testing how\n  the Avocado app would behave on broken pipes on the command line,\n  but it introduced side effects to a lot of Python code.  Instead of\n  exceptions, the affected Python code would receive the signal themselves.\n  \n  This is now reverted to the Python standard, and the signal behavior\n  of Python based tests running on Avocado should not surprise anyone.\n- The project release notes are now part of the official\n  documentation.  That means that users can quickly find when a given\n  change was introduced.\n\nTogether with those changes listed, a total of 38 changes made into\nthis release.  For more information, please check out the complete\n`Avocado changelog\n<https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/compare/38.0...39.0>`_.\n\n# Sprint Theme\n\nAfter so much love that we had on the previous version, let's twist\nthings a bit with an antagonist title.  Info on this pretty good movie\nby Tarantino can be found at:\n\n http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3460252/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_2\n\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_UI1GzaWv0\n\nThe story line:\n\nIn the dead of a Wyoming winter, a bounty hunter and his prisoner\nfind shelter in a cabin currently inhabited by a collection of\nnefarious characters.\n\n# Release Meeting\n\nThe Avocado release meetings are now open to the community via\nHangouts on Air.  The meetings are recorded and made available on the\n`Avocado Test Framework YouTube channel\n<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-RVZ_HFTbEztDM7wNY4NfA>`_.\n\nFor this release, you can watch the meeting on `this link\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GotEH7SmHSw>`_.\n"}

By setting the expire time\n  to `1d` (1 day), your test will benefit from cache on most runs, but\n  will still fetch the new version when the the 24 hours from the\n  first download have passed.\n  \n  For more information, please check out the documentation on the\n  `expire` parameter to the `fetch_asset()` method[1].\n- Environment variables can be propagated into tests running on remote\n  systems.  It's a known fact that one way to influence application behavior,\n  including test, is to set environment variables.  A command line such as::\n\n```\n    $ MYAPP_DEBUG=1 avocado run myapp_test.py\n```\n\n  Will work as expected on a local system.  But Avocado also allows\n  running tests on remote machines, and up until now, it has been\n  lacking a way to propagate environment variables to the remote\n  system.\n\n  Now, you can use::\n\n```\n    $ MYAPP_DEBUG=1 avocado run --env-keep MYAPP_DEBUG \\\n      --remote-host test-machine myapp_test.py\n```\n- The plugin interfaces have been moved into the\n  `avocado.core.plugin_interfaces` module.  This means that plugin\n  writers now have to import the interface definitions this namespace,\n  example::\n\n```\n    ...\n    from avocado.core.plugin_interfaces import CLICmd\n\n    class MyCommand(CLICmd):\n    ...\n```\n\n  This is a way to keep ourselves honest, and say that there's no\n  difference from plugin interfaces to Avocado's core implementation,\n  that is, they may change at will.  For greater stability, one should\n  be tracking the LTS releases.\n\n  Also, it effectively makes all plugins the same, whether they're\n  implemented and shipped as part of Avocado, or as part of external\n  projects.\n- A contrib script for running kvm-unit-tests.  As some people are\n  aware, Avocado has indeed a close relation to virtualization\n  testing.  Avocado-VT is one obvious example, but there are other\n  virtualization related test suites can Avocado can run.\n  \n  This release adds a contrib script that will fetch, download,\n  compile and run kvm-unit-tests using Avocado's external runner\n  feature.  This gives results in a better granularity than the\n  support that exists in Avocado-VT, which gives only a single\n  PASS/FAIL for the entire test suite execution.\n\nFor more information, please check out the Avocado changelog[2].\n\nAlso, while we focused on Avocado, let's also not forget that\nAvocado-VT maintains it's own fast pace of incoming niceties.\n- s390 support: Avocado-VT is breaking into new grounds, and now has\n  support for the s390 architecture.  Fedora 23 for s390 has been added\n  as a valid guest OS, and s390-virtio has been added as a new machine\n  type.\n- Avocado-VT is now more resilient against failures to persist its\n  environment file, and will only give warnings instead of errors when\n  it fails to save it.\n- An improved implementation of the \"job lock\" plugin, which prevents\n  multiple Avocado jobs with VT tests to run simultaneously.  Since\n  there's no finer grained resource locking in Avocado-VT, this is a\n  global lock that will prevent issues such as image corruption when\n  two jobs are run at the same time.\n  \n  This new implementation will now check if existing lock files are\n  stale, that is, they are leftovers from previous run.  If the\n  processes associated with these files are not present, the stale\n  lock files are deleted, removing the need to clean them up manually.\n  It also outputs better debugging information when failures to\n  acquire lock.\n\nThe complete list of changes to Avocado-VT are available on its\nchangelog[3].\n\nWhile not officially part of this release, this development cycle saw\nthe introduction of new tests on our avocado-misc-tests. Go check it\nout!\n\nFinally, since Avocado and Avocado-VT are not newly born anymore, we\ndecided to update information mentioning KVM-Autotest, virt-test on so\non around the web.  This will hopefully redirect new users to the\nAvocado community and avoid confusion.\n\n## Install avocado\n\nInstructions are available in our documentation on how to install\neither with packages or from source[4].\n\nUpdated RPM packages are be available in the project repos for EPEL 6,\nEPEL 7, Fedora 22, Fedora 23 and the newly released Fedora 24.\n\nPlease note that on the next release, we'll drop support for Fedora 22\npackages.\n\nHappy hacking and testing!\n\n---\n\n[1] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.io/en/38.0/WritingTests.html\n[2] https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/compare/37.0...38.0\n[3] https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado-vt/compare/37.0...38.0\n[4] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.io/en/38.0/GetStartedGuide.html#installing-avocado\n"}

This should make sure\n  interoperability is even better on this release.\n- Much more robust handling of test references, aka test URLs.\n  Avocado now properly handles very long test references, and also\n  test references with non-ascii characters.\n- The avocado command line application now provides richer exit\n  status[1].  If your application or custom script depends on the\n  avocado exit status code, you should be fine as avocado still\n  returns zero for success and non-zero for errors.  On error\n  conditions, though, the exit status code are richer and made of\n  combinable (ORable) codes.  This way it's possible to detect that,\n  say, both a test failure and a job timeout occurred in a single\n  execution.\n- [SECURITY RELATED] The remote execution of tests (including in\n  Virtual Machines) now allows for proper checks of host keys[2].\n  Without these checks, avocado is susceptible to a man-in-the-middle\n  attack, by connecting and sending credentials to the wrong machine.\n  This check is _disabled_ by default, because users depend on this\n  behavior when using machines without any prior knowledge such as\n  cloud based virtual machines.  Also, a bug in the underlying SSH\n  library may prevent existing keys to be used if these are in ECDSA\n  format[3].  There's an automated check in place to check for the\n  resolution of the third party library bug.  Expect this feature to\n  be _enabled_ by default in the upcoming releases.\n- Pre/Post Job hooks.  Avocado now defines a proper interface for\n  extension/plugin writers to execute actions while a Job is runnning.\n  Both Pre and Post hooks have access to the Job state (actually, the\n  complete Job instance).  Pre job hooks are called before tests are\n  run, and post job hooks are called at the very end of the job (after\n  tests would have usually finished executing).\n- Pre/Post job scripts[4].  As a feature built on top of the Pre/Post job\n  hooks described earlier, it's now possible to put executable scripts\n  in a configurable location, such as `/etc/avocado/scripts/job/pre.d`\n  and have them called by Avocado before the execution of tests.  The\n  executed scripts will receive some information about the job via\n  environment variables[5].\n- The implementation of proper Test-IDs[6] in the test result\n  directory.\n\nAlso, while not everything is (yet) translated into code, this release\nsaw various and major RFCs, which are definitely shaping the future of\nAvocado.  Among those:\n- Introduce proper test IDs[6]\n- Pre/Post _test_ hooks[7]\n- Multi-stream tests[8]\n- Avocado maintainability and integration with avocado-vt[9]\n- Improvements to job status (completely implemented)[10]\n\nFor a complete list of changes please check the Avocado changelog[11].\n\nFor Avocado-VT, please check the full Avocado-VT changelog[12].\n\n## Install avocado\n\nInstructions are available in our documentation on how to install\neither with packages or from source[13].\n\nUpdated RPM packages are be available in the project repos for\nFedora 22, Fedora 23, EPEL 6 and EPEL 7.\n\n## Packages\n\nAs a heads up, we still package the latest version of the various\nAvocado sub projects, such as the very popular Avocado-VT and the\npretty much experimental Avocado-Virt and Avocado-Server projects.\n\nFor the upcoming releases, there will be changes in our package\noffers, with a greater focus on long term stability packages for\nAvocado.  Other packages may still be offered as a convenience, or\nmay see a change of ownership.  All in the best interest of our users.\nIf you have any concerns or questions, please let us know.\n\nHappy hacking and testing!\n\n---\n\n[1] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/35.0/ResultFormats.html#exit-codes\n[2] https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/blob/35.0/etc/avocado/avocado.conf#L41\n[3] https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/blob/35.0/selftests/functional/test_thirdparty_bugs.py#L17\n[4] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/35.0/ReferenceGuide.html#job-pre-and-post-scripts\n[5] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/35.0/ReferenceGuide.html#script-execution-environment\n[6] https://www.redhat.com/archives/avocado-devel/2016-March/msg00024.html\n[7] https://www.redhat.com/archives/avocado-devel/2016-April/msg00000.html\n[8] https://www.redhat.com/archives/avocado-devel/2016-April/msg00042.html\n[9] https://www.redhat.com/archives/avocado-devel/2016-April/msg00038.html\n[10] https://www.redhat.com/archives/avocado-devel/2016-April/msg00010.html\n[11] https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/compare/0.34.0...35.0\n[13] https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado-vt/compare/0.34.0...35.0\n[12] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/35.0/GetStartedGuide.html#installing-avocado\n"}

This\n  means that all Avocado output uses the standard Python logging library\n  making it very consistent and easy to understand [1].\n- Based on the logging and output overhaul, the command line test\n  runner is now very flexible with its output. A user can choose\n  exactly what should be output. Examples include application output\n  only, test output only, both application and test output or any\n  other combination of the builtin streams. The user visible command\n  line option that controls this behavior is `--show`, which is an\n  application level option, that is, it's available to all avocado\n  commands. [2]\n- Besides the builtin streams, test writers can use the standard\n  Python logging API to create new streams. These streams can be shown\n  on the command line as mentioned before, or persisted automatically\n  in the job results by means of the `--store-logging-stream` command\n  line option. [3][4]\n- The new `avocado.core.safeloader` module, intends to make it easier\n  to to write new test loaders for various types of Python\n  code. [5][6]\n- Based on the new `avocado.core.safeloader` module, a contrib script\n  called `avocado-find-unittests`, returns the name of\n  unittest.TestCase based tests found on a given number of Python\n  source code files. [7]\n- Avocado is now able to run its own selftest suite. By leveraging the\n  `avocado-find-unittests` contrib script and the External Runner [8]\n  feature. A Makefile target is available, allowing developers to run\n  `make selfcheck` to have the selftest suite run by Avocado. [9]\n- Partial Python 3 support. A number of changes were introduced that\n  allow concurrent Python 2 and 3 support on the same code base.  Even\n  though the support for Python 3 is still _incomplete_, the `avocado`\n  command line application can already run some limited commands at\n  this point.\n- Asset fetcher utility library. This new utility library, and\n  INSTRUMENTED test feature, allows users to transparently request\n  external assets to be used in tests, having them cached for later\n  use. [10]\n- Further cleanups in the public namespace of the avocado Test class.\n- [BUG FIX] Input from the local system was being passed to remote\n  systems when running tests with either in remote systems or VMs.\n- [BUG FIX] HTML report stability improvements, including better\n  Unicode handling and support for other versions of the Pystache\n  library.\n- [BUG FIX] Atomic updates of the \"latest\" job symlink, allows for\n  more reliable user experiences when running multiple parallel jobs.\n- [BUG FIX] The avocado.core.data_dir module now dynamically checks\n  the configuration system when deciding where the data directory\n  should be located. This allows for later updates, such as when\n  giving one extra `--config` parameter in the command line, to be\n  applied consistently throughout the framework and test code.\n- [MAINTENANCE] The CI jobs now run full checks on each commit on\n  any proposed PR, not only on its topmost commit. This gives higher\n  confidence that a commit in a series is not causing breakage that\n  a later commit then inadvertently fixes.\n\nFor a complete list of changes please check the Avocado changelog[11].\n\nFor Avocado-VT, please check the full Avocado-VT changelog[12].\n\n## Avocado Videos\n\nAs yet another way to let users know about what's available in\nAvocado, we're introducing short videos with very targeted content on\nour very own YouTube channel:\n\n https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP4xob52XwRad0bU_8V28rQ\n\nThe first video available demonstrates a couple of new features\nrelated to the advanced logging mechanisms, introduced on this\nrelease:\n\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ur_p5p6YiQ\n\n## Install avocado\n\nInstructions are available in our documentation on how to install\neither with packages or from source[13].\n\nUpdated RPM packages are be available in the project repos for\nFedora 22, Fedora 23, EPEL 6 and EPEL 7.\n\nHappy hacking and testing!\n\n---\n\n[1] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/0.34.0/LoggingSystem.html\n[2] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/0.34.0/LoggingSystem.html#tweaking-the-ui\n[3] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/0.34.0/LoggingSystem.html#storing-custom-logs\n[4] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/0.34.0/WritingTests.html#advanced-logging-capabilities\n[5] https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/blob/0.34.0/avocado/core/safeloader.py\n[6] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/0.34.0/api/core/avocado.core.html#module-avocado.core.safeloader\n[7] https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/blob/0.34.0/contrib/avocado-find-unittests\n[8] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/0.34.0/GetStartedGuide.html#running-tests-with-an-external-runner\n[9] https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/blob/0.34.0/Makefile#L33\n[10] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/0.34.0/WritingTests.html#fetching-asset-files\n[11] https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/compare/0.33.0...0.34.0\n[12] https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado-vt/compare/0.33.0...0.34.0\n[13] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/latest/GetStartedGuide.html#installing-avocado\n"}

Right on time for the holidays, Avocado reaches the end\nof Sprint 31, and together with it, we're very happy to announce a brand\nnew release! This version brings stability fixes and improvements to\nboth Avocado and Avocado-VT, some new features and a major redesign of\nour plugin architecture.\n\nFor Avocado the main changes are:\n- It's now possible to register callback functions to be executed when\n  all tests finish, that is, at the end of a particular job[1].\n- The software manager utility library received a lot of love on the\n  Debian side of things. If you're writing tests that install software\n  packages on Debian systems, you may be in for some nice treats and\n  much more reliable results.\n- Passing malformed commands (such as ones that can not be properly\n  split by the standard shlex library) to the process utility library\n  is now better dealt with.\n- The test runner code received some refactors and it's a lot easier\n  to follow. If you want to understand how the Avocado test runner\n  communicates with the processes that run the test themselves, you\n  may have a much better code reading experience now.\n- Updated inspektor to the latest and greatest, so that our code is\n  kept is shiny and good looking (and performing) as possible.\n- Fixes to the utility GIT library when using a specific local branch\n  name.\n- Changes that allow our selftest suite to run properly on virtualenvs.\n- Proper installation requirements definition for Python 2.6 systems.\n- A completely new plugin architecture[2]. Now we offload all plugin\n  discovery and loading to the Stevedore library. Avocado now defines\n  precise (and simpler) interfaces for plugin writers. Please be aware\n  that the public and documented interfaces for plugins, at the\n  moment, allows adding new commands to the avocado command line app,\n  or adding new options to existing commands. Other functionality can\n  be achived by \"abusing\" the core avocado API from within\n  plugins. Our goal is to expand the interfaces so that other areas of\n  the framework can be extended just as easily.\n\nFor a complete list of changes please check the Avocado changelog[3].\n\nAvocado-VT received just too many fixes and improvements to\nlist. Please refer to the changelog[4] for more information.\n\n## Install avocado\n\nInstructions are available in our documentation on how to install\neither with packages or from source[5].\n\nWithin a couple of hours, updated RPM packages will be available in\nthe project repos for Fedora 22, Fedora 23, EPEL 6 and EPEL 7.\n\nHappy hacking and testing!\n\n---\n\n[1] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/0.31.0/ReferenceGuide.html#job-cleanup\n[2] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/0.31.0/Plugins.html\n[3] https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/compare/0.30.0...0.31.0\n[4] https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado-vt/compare/0.30.0...0.31.0\n[5] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/0.31.0/GetStartedGuide.html\n"}

Avocado reaches the end of Sprint 30, and with it, we have a new release available! This version brings stability fixes and improvements to both Avocado and Avocado-vt.\n\nAs software doesn't spring out of life itself, we'd like to acknowledge the major contributions by Lucas (AKA lmr) since the dawn of time for Avocado (and earlier projects like Autotest and virt-test). Although the Avocado team at Red Hat was hit by some changes, we're already extremely happy to see that this major contributor (and good friend) has not gone too far.\n\nNow back to the more informational part of the release notes. For Avocado the main changes are:\n- New RPM repository location, check the docs[1] for instructions on how to install the latest releases\n- Makefile rules for building RPMs are now based on mock, to ensure sound dependencies\n- Packaged versions are now available for Fedora 22, newly released Fedora 23, EL6 and EL7\n- The software manager utility library now supports DNF\n- The avocado test runner now supports a dry run mode, which allows users to check how a job would be executed, including tests that would be found and parameters that would be passed to it. This is currently complementary to the avocado list command.\n- The avocado test runner now supports running simple tests with parameters. This may come in handy for simple use cases when Avocado will wrap a test suite, but the test suite needs some command line arguments.\n\nAvocado-vt also received many bugfixes[3].

You can see the specific documentation of this one at our readthedocs page [1]\n- Test introspection/listing is safer: Now avocado does not load python modules to introspect its contents, an alternative method, based on the Python AST parser is used, which means now avocado will not load possible badly written/malicious code at listing stage. You can find more about that in our test resolution documentation [2]\n- You can now specify low level loaders to avocado to customize your test running experience. You can learn more about that in the Test Discovery documentation [3]\n- The usual many bugfixes and polishing commits. You can see the full amount of 96 commits at [4]\n\nFor our Avocado VT plugin, the main changes are:\n- The vt-bootstrap process is now more robust against users interrupting previous bootstrap attempts\n- Some issues with RPM install in RHEL hosts were fixed\n- Issues with unsafe temporary directories were fixed, making the VT tests more secure.\n- Issues with unattended installed were fixed\n- Now the address of the virbr0 bridge is properly auto detected, which means that our unattended installation content server will work out of the box as long as you have a working virbr0 bridge.\n\nInstall avocado\n\nAs usual, go to https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/lmr/Autotest/ to install\nour YUM/DNF repo and get the latest goodies!\n\nHappy hacking and testing!\n\n[1] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/0.29.0\n[2] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/0.29.0/ReferenceGuide.html#test-resolution\n[3] http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/0.29.0/Loaders.html\n[4] https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/compare/0.28.0...0.29.0\n"}

The most exciting news for this release is that our avocado-vt plugin was merged with the virt-test project. The avocado-vt plugin will be very important for QEMU/KVM/Libvirt developers, so the main avocado received updates to better support the goal of having a good quality avocado-vt.\n\nChanges in avocado:\n- The avocado human output received some tweaks and it's more compact, while still being informative. Here's an example:\n  \n  ```\n  JOB ID     : f2f5060440bd57cba646c1f223ec8c40d03f539b\n  JOB LOG    : /home/user/avocado/job-results/job-2015-07-27T17.13-f2f5060/job.log\n  JOB HTML   : /home/user/avocado/job-results/job-2015-07-27T17.13-f2f5060/html/results.html\n  TESTS      : 1\n  (1/1) passtest.py:PassTest.test: PASS (0.00 s)\n  RESULTS    : PASS 1 | ERROR 0 | FAIL 0 | SKIP 0 | WARN 0 | INTERRUPT 0\n  TIME       : 0.00 s\n  ```\n- The avocado test loader was refactored and behaves more consistently in different test loading scenarios.\n- The `utils` API received new modules and functions:\n  - NEW avocado.utils.cpu: APIs related to CPU information on linux boxes [1]\n  - NEW avocado.utils.git: APIs to clone/update git repos [2]\n  - NEW avocado.utils.iso9660: Get information about ISO files [3]\n  - NEW avocado.utils.service: APIs to control services on linux boxes (systemv and systemd) [4]\n  - NEW avocado.utils.output: APIs that help avocado based CLI programs to display results to users [5]\n  - UPDATE avocado.utils.download: Add url_download_interactive\n  - UPDATE avocado.utils.download: Add new params to get_file\n- Bugfixes. You may refer to [6] for the full list of 64 commits.\n\nChanges in avocado-vt:\n- Merged virt-test into avocado-vt. Basically, the virt-test core library (virttest) replaced most uses of autotest by equivalent avocado API calls, and its code was brought up to the virt-test repository [7]. This means, among other things, that you can simply install avocado-vt through RPM and enjoy all the virt tests without having to clone another repository manually to bootstrap your tests. More details about the process will be sent on an e-mail to the avocado and virt-test mailing lists. Please go to [8] for instructions on how to get started with all our new tools.\n\nSee you in a couple of weeks for our next release!

This was made because by definition, if we get to the\n  test execution step, by definition it can't be skipped anymore. It's important\n  to keep the concepts clear and well separated if we want to give users a good\n  experience.\n- More documentation polish and updates. Make sure you check out our documentation\n  website http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.\n- A number of avocado command line options and help text was reviewed and\n  updated.\n- A new, leaner and mobile friendly version of the avocado website is live.\n  Please check http://avocado-framework.github.io/ for more information.\n- We have the first version of the avocado dashboard! avocado dashboard is the\n  initial version of an avocado web interface, and will serve as the frontend\n  to our testing database.

This is an\nimportant milestone in avocado development, and we would like to invite\nyou to be a part of the development process, by contributing PRs, testing\nand giving feedback on the test runner's usability and new plugins we came\nup with.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nThis is the first release aimed for general use. We did our best to deliver\na coherent and enjoyable experience, but keep in mind that it's a young\nproject, so please set your expectations accordingly. What is expected to work\nwell:\n- Running avocado 'instrumented' tests\n- Running arbitrary executables as tests\n- Automatic test discovery and run of tests on directories\n- xUnit/JSON report\n\nKnown Issues\n- HTML report of test jobs with multiplexed tests has a minor naming display\n  issue that is scheduled to be fixed by next release.\n- avocado-vt might fail to load if virt-test was not properly bootstrapped.\n  Make sure you always run bootstrap in the virt-test directory on any\n  virt-test git updates to prevent the issue. Next release will have more\n  mechanisms to give the user better error messages on tough to judge\n  situations (virt-test repo with stale or invalid config files that need\n  update).\n\nChanges\n- The Avocado API has been greatly streamlined. After a long discussion and\n  several rounds of reviews and planning, now we have a clear separation of\n  what is intended as functions useful for test developers and plugin/core\n  developers:\n  - avocado.core is intended for plugin/core developers. Things are more fluid\n    on this space, so that we can move fast with development\n  - avocado.utils is a generic library, with functions we found out to be\n    useful for a variety of tests and core code alike.\n  - avocado has some symbols exposed at its top level, with the test API:\n    - our Test() class, derived from the unittest.TestCase() class\n    - a main() entry point, similar to unittest.main()\n    - VERSION, that gives the user the avocado version (eg 0.25.0).\n      Those symbols and classes/APIs will be changed more carefully, and release\n      notes will certainly contain API update notices. In other words, we'll be\n      a lot more mindful of changes in this area, to reduce the maintenance cost\n      of writing avocado tests.\n  \n  We believe this more strict separation between the available APIs will help\n  test developers to quickly identify what they need for test development, and\n  reduce following a fast moving target, what usually happens when we have a\n  new project that does not have clear policies behind its API design.\n- There's a new plugin added to the avocado project: avocado-vt. This plugin\n  acts as a wrapper for the virt-test test suite\n  (https://github.com/autotest/virt-test), allowing people to use avocado to\n  list and run the tests available for that test suite. This allows people to\n  leverage a number of the new cool avocado features for the virt tests\n  themselves:\n  - HTML reports, a commonly asked feature for the virt-test suite. You can\n    see a screenshot of what the report looks like here:\n    https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/296807/7406339/7699689e-eed7-11e4-9214-38a678c105ec.png\n  - You can run virt-tests on arbitrary order, and multiple instances of a\n    given test, something that is also currently not possible with the virt\n    test runner (also a commonly asked feature for the suite.\n  - System info collection. It's a flexible feature, you get to configure\n    easily what gets logged/recorded between tests.\n- The avocado multiplexer (test matrix representation/generation system)\n  also received a lot of work and fixes during this\n  release. One of the most visible (and cool) features of 0.25.0 is the new,\n  improved --tree representation of the multiplexer file:\n  \n  ```\n   $ avocado multiplex examples/mux-environment.yaml -tc\n     \u2517\u2501\u2501 run\n          \u2523\u2501\u2501 hw\n          \u2503    \u2523\u2501\u2501 cpu\n          \u2503    \u2503    \u2560\u2550\u2550 intel\n          \u2503    \u2503    \u2551     \u2192 cpu_CFLAGS: -march=core2\n          \u2503    \u2503    \u2560\u2550\u2550 amd\n          \u2503    \u2503    \u2551     \u2192 cpu_CFLAGS: -march=athlon64\n          \u2503    \u2503    \u255a\u2550\u2550 arm\n          \u2503    \u2503          \u2192 cpu_CFLAGS: -mabi=apcs-gnu -march=armv8-a -mtune=arm8\n          \u2503    \u2517\u2501\u2501 disk\n          \u2503         \u2560\u2550\u2550 scsi\n          \u2503         \u2551     \u2192 disk_type: scsi\n          \u2503         \u255a\u2550\u2550 virtio\n          \u2503               \u2192 disk_type: virtio\n          \u2523\u2501\u2501 distro\n          \u2503    \u2560\u2550\u2550 fedora\n          \u2503    \u2551     \u2192 init: systemd\n          \u2503    \u255a\u2550\u2550 mint\n          \u2503          \u2192 init: systemv\n          \u2517\u2501\u2501 env\n               \u2560\u2550\u2550 debug\n               \u2551     \u2192 opt_CFLAGS: -O0 -g\n               \u255a\u2550\u2550 prod\n                     \u2192 opt_CFLAGS: -O2\n  ```\n  \n  We hope you find the multiplexer useful and enjoyable.\n- If an avocado plugin fails to load, due to factors such as missing\n  dependencies, environment problems and misconfiguration, in order to notify\n  users and make them mindful of what it takes to fix the root causes for the\n  loading errors, those errors are displayed in the avocado stderr stream.\n  \n  However, often we can't fix the problem right now and don't need\n  the constant stderr nagging. If that's the case, you can set in your local\n  config file:\n  \n  ```\n    [plugins]\n    # Suppress notification about broken plugins in the app standard error.\n    # Add the name of each broken plugin you want to suppress the notification\n    # in the list. The names can be easily seen from the stderr messages. Example:\n    # avocado.core.plugins.htmlresult  ImportError No module named pystache\n    # add 'avocado.core.plugins.htmlresult' as an element of the list below.\n    skip_broken_plugin_notification = []\n  ```\n- Our documentation has received a big review, that led to a number of\n  improvements.

This time, we had made a number of API changes to reflect some good practices in API development, and changes to the multiplexer, that is making large steps towards a production ready state. Let's break down the changes:\n\nCore/General API isolation\n\nIn order to avoid user confusion, now the `avocado` API has a clear separation with regards to what it's supposed to be used by test developers, and what is supposed to be used by plugin/core application developers:\n- `avocado.core` is restricted to plugin/core app developers\n- `avocado` can be used by both test developers and plugin/core app developers\n\nBreakdown of changes:\n- `avocado.core.data_dir` -> `avocado.data_dir`\n- `avocado.plugins` -> `avocado.core.plugins`\n- `avocado.remote` -> `avocado.core.remote`\n- `avocado.job` -> `avocado.core.job`\n- `avocado.job.main` -> `avocado.main`\n- `avocado.loader` -> `avocado.core.loader`\n- `avocado.output` -> `avocado.core.output`\n- `avocado.loader` -> `avocado.core.loader`\n- `avocado.parser` -> `avocado.core.parser`\n- `avocado.runner` -> `avocado.core.runner`\n- `avocado.sysinfo` -> `avocado.core.sysinfo`\n- `avocado.external.gdbmi_parser` -> `avocado.core.gdbmi_parser`\n- `avocado.external.spark` -> `avocado.core.spark`\n- `avocado.cli.app` -> `avocado.core.app`\n- `avocado.exceptions` -> `avocado.core.exceptions`\n\nMultiplexer\n\nThe multiplexer has gone through changes on the parameters retrieval API. The new way of retrieving params is through the `get` API, that has the form::\n\n```\nget(key, path, default)\n```\n\nThe `avocado.test.Test.params` object is no longer a dictionary, and it's not possible to refer to the values through the shortcut `avocado.test.Test.params.key` anymore.\n\nExample of old usage::\n\n```\nc_file = self.get_data_path(self.params.get('source', 'doublefree.c'))\n```\n\nThis statement has to be updated to::\n\n```\nc_file = self.get_data_path(self.params.get('source', default='doublefree.c'))\n```\n\nOtherwise the default `doublefree.c` value will be taken as the retrieval path, then c_file would be `None`.\n\nThe multiplexer file format also has a new `!mux` tag, that means to recursively multiplex all nodes below the specified tag. By default now, we don't multiplex until the `!mux` tag is specified. Let's consider the following file::\n\n```\nhw:\n    cpu:\n    intel:\n        cpu_CFLAGS: '-march=core2'\n    amd:\n        cpu_CFLAGS: '-march=athlon64'\n    arm:\n        cpu_CFLAGS: '-mabi=apcs-gnu -march=armv8-a -mtune=arm8'\n    disk:\n    scsi:\n        disk_type: 'scsi'\n    virtio:\n        disk_type: 'virtio'\ndistro:\n    fedora:\n    init: 'systemd'\n    mint:\n    init: 'systemv'\nenv:\n    debug:\n    opt_CFLAGS: '-O0 -g'\n    prod:\n    opt_CFLAGS: '-O2'\n```\n\nHere, the nodes `cpu`, `disk`, `distro` and `env` are the ones we actually want to combine, while `hw` is just for organization purposes (we don't want to combine `hw` with `distro`, really).\n\nNew version, with `!mux`:\n\n```\nhw:\n    cpu: !mux\n    intel:\n        cpu_CFLAGS: '-march=core2'\n    amd:\n        cpu_CFLAGS: '-march=athlon64'\n    arm:\n        cpu_CFLAGS: '-mabi=apcs-gnu -march=armv8-a -mtune=arm8'\n    disk: !mux\n    scsi:\n        disk_type: 'scsi'\n    virtio:\n        disk_type: 'virtio'\ndistro: !mux\n    fedora:\n    init: 'systemd'\n    mint:\n    init: 'systemv'\nenv: !mux\n    debug:\n    opt_CFLAGS: '-O0 -g'\n    prod:\n    opt_CFLAGS: '-O2'\n```\n\nThis way we can keep using `hw` as a organization label, not interfering with our final purpose of combining only `cpu`, `disk`, `distro` and `env`. The variants generated with the new tag arrangement are:\n\n```\nVariant 1:    /hw/cpu/intel, /hw/disk/scsi, /distro/fedora, /env/debug\nVariant 2:    /hw/cpu/intel, /hw/disk/scsi, /distro/fedora, /env/prod\nVariant 3:    /hw/cpu/intel, /hw/disk/scsi, /distro/mint, /env/debug\nVariant 4:    /hw/cpu/intel, /hw/disk/scsi, /distro/mint, /env/prod\nVariant 5:    /hw/cpu/intel, /hw/disk/virtio, /distro/fedora, /env/debug\nVariant 6:    /hw/cpu/intel, /hw/disk/virtio, /distro/fedora, /env/prod\nVariant 7:    /hw/cpu/intel, /hw/disk/virtio, /distro/mint, /env/debug\nVariant 8:    /hw/cpu/intel, /hw/disk/virtio, /distro/mint, /env/prod\nVariant 9:    /hw/cpu/amd, /hw/disk/scsi, /distro/fedora, /env/debug\nVariant 10:    /hw/cpu/amd, /hw/disk/scsi, /distro/fedora, /env/prod\nVariant 11:    /hw/cpu/amd, /hw/disk/scsi, /distro/mint, /env/debug\nVariant 12:    /hw/cpu/amd, /hw/disk/scsi, /distro/mint, /env/prod\nVariant 13:    /hw/cpu/amd, /hw/disk/virtio, /distro/fedora, /env/debug\nVariant 14:    /hw/cpu/amd, /hw/disk/virtio, /distro/fedora, /env/prod\nVariant 15:    /hw/cpu/amd, /hw/disk/virtio, /distro/mint, /env/debug\nVariant 16:    /hw/cpu/amd, /hw/disk/virtio, /distro/mint, /env/prod\nVariant 17:    /hw/cpu/arm, /hw/disk/scsi, /distro/fedora, /env/debug\nVariant 18:    /hw/cpu/arm, /hw/disk/scsi, /distro/fedora, /env/prod\nVariant 19:    /hw/cpu/arm, /hw/disk/scsi, /distro/mint, /env/debug\nVariant 20:    /hw/cpu/arm, /hw/disk/scsi, /distro/mint, /env/prod\nVariant 21:    /hw/cpu/arm, /hw/disk/virtio, /distro/fedora, /env/debug\nVariant 22:    /hw/cpu/arm, /hw/disk/virtio, /distro/fedora, /env/prod\nVariant 23:    /hw/cpu/arm, /hw/disk/virtio, /distro/mint, /env/debug\nVariant 24:    /hw/cpu/arm, /hw/disk/virtio, /distro/mint, /env/prod\n```\n\nThe tree representation also changed to print the `!mux` points of branching, to further help the user to understand the structure of the tree::\n\n```\n$ scripts/avocado multiplex --tree examples/mux-environment.yaml \nConfig file tree structure:\n\n        /-intel\n       |\n     /cpu-<>--amd\n    |      |\n  /hw       \\-arm\n |  |\n |  |        /-scsi\n |   \\disk-<>\n |           \\-virtio\n-|\n |          /-fedora\n |-distro-<>\n |          \\-mint\n |\n |       /-debug\n  \\env-<>\n     \\-prod\n```\n\nThe more detailed breakdown of the 145 commits can be seen here:\n\nhttps://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/compare/0.23.0...0.24.0\n\nHappy testing!\n"}

I'm here to announce the new Avocado 0.23.0 release! This time around, we have a few changes worth of note:\n- Now avocado looks more like nose and other unittest based test runners: You can define a number of test methods prefixed with `test`, and the runner will simply run them. Also, for compatibility with the base unittest class, now `setup` and `cleanup` are `setUp` and `tearDown`. \n\nLet's see how an old avocado test looked like:\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/python\nfrom avocado import test\nfrom avocado import job\n\n\nclass OldTest(test.Test):\n\n    def setup(self):\n    self.hello = \"Hi there!\"\n\n    def action(self):\n    self.assertEqual(self.hello, \"Hi there!\")\n\n    def cleanup(self):\n    self.log.debug('Cleanup')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    job.main()\n```\n\nThe new avocado tests look like this:\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/python\nfrom avocado import test\nfrom avocado import job\n\n\nclass MultipleTests(test.Test):\n\n    def setUp(self):\n    self.hello = \"Hi there!\"\n\n    def test_hello(self):\n    self.assertEqual(self.hello, \"Hi there!\")\n\n    def testIdentity(self):\n    self.assertTrue(1, 1)\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n    self.log.debug('Cleanup')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    job.main()\n```\n- `avocado run`: Simplified command line options, cutting off a number of rarely used options and moving them to config file entries\n- `avocado run`: Added the `--job-timeout` option, that allows users to specify the maximum time an avocado test job might take.\n- `avocado run`: Consolidated the options `--remote-timeout` and `--vm-timeout` into `--job-timeout`.\n- Sysinfo feature: The sysinfo feature went through refactoring and simplification - Now it is possible to specify what information from the system is to be collected through config files\n\nSee how to configure your collectibles:\n\n```\n[sysinfo.collectibles]\n# File with list of commands that will be executed and have their output collected\ncommands = /etc/avocado/sysinfo/commands\n# File with list of files that will be collected verbatim\nfiles = /etc/avocado/sysinfo/files\n# File with list of commands that will run alongside the job/test\nprofilers = /etc/avocado/sysinfo/profilers\n```\n\nThe default `commands` file looks like:\n\n```\ndf -mP\ndmesg -c\nuname -a\nlspci -vvnn\ngcc --version\nld --version\nmount\nhostname\nuptime\ndmidecode\nifconfig -a\nbrctl show\nip link\nnumactl --hardware show\nlscpu\nfdisk -l\n```\n- Multiplexer: A new params retrieval system is in place. Now, instead of `self.params.key` you must use the `self.params.get(key, path, default)` API. A compatibility layer with the old dict structure was made, but we encourage you to migrate your param retrieval calls from `self.params.key` or `self.params['key'] to`self.params.get('key').\n\nThe full list of commits can be seen here:\n\nhttps://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/compare/0.21.0...0.23.0\n\nHappy testing!\n"}
