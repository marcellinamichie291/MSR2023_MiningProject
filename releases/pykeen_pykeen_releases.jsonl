These can be generally reused, even outside of the typical PyKEEN workflows.\r\n- Modular forms of all interaction models (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/242, [pykeen.nn.modules documentation](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/nn/modules.html)). These wrap the functional forms of interaction models and store hyper-parameters such as the ``p`` value for the L_p norm in TransE.\r\n- The initializer, normalizer, and constrainer for the entity and relation embeddings are now exposed through the ``__init__()`` function of each KGEM class and can be configured. A future update will enable HPO on these as well (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/282).\r\n\r\n## Refactoring and Future Preparation\r\n\r\nThis release contains a few big refactors. Most won't affect end-users, but if you're writing your own PyKEEN models, these are important. Many of them are motivated to make it possible to introduce a new interface that makes it much easier for researchers (who shouldn't have to understand the inner workings of PyKEEN) to make new models.\r\n\r\n- The regularizer has been refactored (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/266,\r\n  https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/274). It no longer accepts a ``torch.device`` when instantiated.\r\n- The ``pykeen.nn.Embedding`` class has been improved in several ways:\r\n  - Embedding Specification class makes it easier to write new classes (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/277)\r\n  - Refactor to make shape of embedding explicit (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/287)\r\n  - Specification of complex datatype (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/292)\r\n- Refactoring of the loss model class to provide a meaningful class hierarchy (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/256, https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/262)\r\n- Refactoring of the base model class to provide a consistent interface (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/246, https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/248, https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/253, https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/257). This allowed for simplification of the loss computation based on the new hierarchy and also new implementation of regularizer class.\r\n- More automated testing of typing with MyPy (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/255) and automated checking of documentation with ``doctests`` (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/291)\r\n\r\n## Triples Loading\r\n\r\nWe've made some improvements to the ``pykeen.triples.TriplesFactory`` to facilitate loading even larger datasets (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/216). However, this required an interface change. This will affect any code that loads custom triples. If you're loading triples from a path, you should now use:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npath = ...\r\n# Old (doesn't work anymore)\r\ntf = TriplesFactory(path=path)\r\n\r\n# New\r\ntf = TriplesFactory.from_path(path)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Predictions\r\n\r\nWhile refactoring the base model class, we excised the prediction functionality to a new module ``pykeen.models.predict`` (docs: https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/predict.html#functions). We also renamed some of the prediction functions inside the base model to make them more consistent, but we now recommend you use the functions from ``pykeen.models.predict`` instead.\r\n\r\n- ``Model.predict_heads()`` -> ``Model.get_head_prediction_df()``\r\n- ``Model.predict_relations()`` -> ``Model.get_head_prediction_df()``\r\n- ``Model.predict_tails()`` -> ``Model.get_head_prediction_df()``\r\n- ``Model.score_all_triples()`` -> ``Model.get_all_prediction_df()``\r\n\r\n## Fixed\r\n\r\n- Do not create inverse triples for validation and testing factory (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/270)\r\n- Treat nonzero applied to large tensor error as OOM for batch size search (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/279)\r\n- Fix bug in loading ConceptNet (https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen/issues/290). If your experiments relied on this\r\n  dataset, you should rerun them.\r\n"}
