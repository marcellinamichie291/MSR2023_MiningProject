This proved to be bad as soon as one wanted to add more fields. For this reason, they were migrated to use JSON instead. But this proved to be bad as soon as one wanted to save things like entities (usernames, their ID and hash), so now it properly uses [**`sqlite3`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html), which has been well tested, to save the session files! Calling `.get_input_entity` using a `username` no longer will need to fetch it first, so it's really 0 calls again. Calling `.get_entity` will always fetch the most up to date version.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, nearly everything has been documented, thus preparing the library for [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) (although there are a few things missing I'd like to polish first), and the [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) are now better placed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* `.get_dialogs()` now returns a **single list** instead a tuple consisting of a **custom class** that should make everything easier to work with.\r\n* `.get_message_history()` also returns a **single list** instead a tuple, with the `Message` instances modified to make them more convenient.\r\n\r\nBoth lists have a `.total` attribute so you can still know how many dialogs/messages are in total.\r\n\r\n### New stuff\r\n* The mentioned use of `sqlite3` for the session file.\r\n* `.get_entity()` now supports lists too, and it will make as little API calls as possible if you feed it `InputPeer` types. Usernames will always be resolved, since they may have changed.\r\n* `.set_proxy()` method, to avoid having to create a new `TelegramClient`.\r\n* More `date` types supported to represent a date parameter.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n* Empty strings weren't working when they were a flag parameter (e.g., setting no last name).\r\n* Fix invalid assertion regarding flag parameters as well.\r\n* Avoid joining the background thread on disconnect, as it would be `None` due to a race condition.\r\n* Correctly handle `None` dates when downloading media.\r\n* `.download_profile_photo` was failing for some channels.\r\n* `.download_media` wasn't handling `Photo`.\r\n\r\n### Internal changes\r\n* `date` was being serialized as local date, but that was wrong.\r\n* `date` was being represented as a `float` instead of an `int`.\r\n* `.tl` parser wasn't stripping inline comments.\r\n* Removed some redundant checks on `update_state.py`.\r\n* Use a [synchronized queue](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html) instead a hand crafted version.\r\n* Use signed integers consistently (e.g. `salt`).\r\n* Always read the corresponding `TLObject` from API responses, except for some special cases still.\r\n* A few more `except` low level to correctly wrap errors.\r\n* More accurate exception types.\r\n* `invokeWithLayer(initConnection(X))` now wraps every first request after `.connect()`.\r\n\r\nAs always, report if you have issues with some of the changes!"}

It works in a similar fashion to the official clients (defaults to double underscore/asterisk, like `**this**`). Please report any issues with emojies or enhancements for the parser!\r\n* New `.idle()` method so your main thread can do useful job (listen for updates).\r\n* Add missing `.to_dict()`, `__str__` and `.stringify()` for `TLMessage` and `MessageContainer`.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n* The list of known peers could end \"corrupted\" and have users with `access_hash=None`, resulting in `struct` error for it not being an integer. You shouldn't encounter this issue anymore.\r\n* The warning for \"added update handler but no workers set\" wasn't actually working.\r\n* `.get_input_peer` was ignoring a case for `InputPeerSelf`.\r\n* There used to be an exception when logging exceptions (whoops) on update handlers.\r\n* \"Downloading contacts\" would produce strange output if they had semicolons (`;`) in their name.\r\n* Fix some cyclic imports and installing dependencies from the `git` repository.\r\n* Code generation was using f-strings, which are only supported on Python \u22653.6.\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n* The `auth_key` generation has been moved from `.connect()` to `.invoke()`. There were some issues were `.connect()` failed and the `auth_key` was `None` so this will ensure to have a valid `auth_key` when needed, even if `BrokenAuthKeyError` is raised.\r\n* Support for higher limits on `.get_history()` and `.get_dialogs()`.\r\n* Much faster integer factorization when generating the required `auth_key`.

You can now also override the attributes.\r\n* ` EntityDatabase.__delitem__` wasn't working.\r\n* `.send_message()` was failing with channels.\r\n* `.get_dialogs(limit=None)` should now return all the dialogs correctly.\r\n* Temporary fix for abusive duplicated updates.\r\n\r\n### Enhancements:\r\n* You will be warned if you call `.add_update_handler` with no `update_workers`.\r\n* New customizable threshold value on the session to determine when to automatically sleep on flood waits. See `client.session.flood_sleep_threshold`.\r\n* New `.get_drafts()` method with a custom `Draft` class by @JosXa.\r\n* Join all threads when calling `.disconnect()`, to assert no dangling thread is left alive.\r\n* Larger chunk when downloading files should result in faster downloads.\r\n* You can use a callable key for the `EntityDatabase`, so it can be any filter you need.\r\n\r\n### Internal changes:\r\n* MsgsAck is now sent in a container rather than its own request.\r\n* `.get_input_photo` is now used in the generated code.\r\n* `.process_entities` was being called from more places than only `__call__`.\r\n* `MtProtoSender` now relies more on the generated code to read responses.\r\n"}

The session will, by default, save all key-value pairs of the entity identifiers and their hashes (since Telegram may send an ID that it thinks you already know about, we need to save this information).\r\n\r\nYou can **prevent** the `EntityDatabase` from saving users by setting `client.session.entities.enabled = False`, and prevent the `Session` from saving input entities at all by setting `client.session.save_entities = False`. You can also clear the cache for a certain user through `client.session.entities.clear_cache(entity=None)`, which will clear all if no entity is given.\r\n\r\nMore things:\r\n* `.sign_in` accepts phones as integers.\r\n* `.get_dialogs()` doesn't fail on Windows anymore, and returns the right amount of dialogs.\r\n* New method to `.delete_messages()`.\r\n* New `ChannelPrivateError` class\r\n* Changing the IP to which you connect to is as simple as `client.session.server_address = 'ip'`, since now the server address is always queried from the session.\r\n* `GeneralProxyError` should be passed to the main thread again, so that you can handle it."}

It's the **Updates Overhaul Update**; let's get right into it!\r\n\r\n### New stuff and enhancements\r\n* You can **invoke** requests from **update handlers**. And **any other thread**. A new temporary will be made, so that you can be sending even several requests at the same time!\r\n* **Several worker threads** for your updates! By default, `None` will spawn. I recommend you to work with `update_workers=4` to get started, these will be polling constantly for updates.\r\n* You can also change the number of workers at any given time.\r\n* The library can now run **in a single thread** again, if you don't need to spawn any at all. Simply set `spawn_read_thread=False` when creating the `TelegramClient`!\r\n* You can specify `limit=None` on `.get_dialogs()` to get **all** of them<sup>[1]</sup>.\r\n* **Updates are expanded**, so you don't need to check if the update has `.updates` or an inner `.update` anymore.\r\n* All `InputPeer` entities are **saved in the session** file, but you can disable this by setting `save_entities=False`.\r\n* New `.get_input_entity` method, which makes use of the above feature. You **should use this** when a request needs a `InputPeer`, rather than the whole entity (although both work).\r\n\r\n### Less important enhancements\r\n* Assert that either all or None dependent-flag parameters are set before sending the request.\r\n* Phone numbers can have dashes, spaces, or parenthesis. They'll be removed before making the request.\r\n* You can override the phone and its hash on `.sign_in()`, if you're creating a new `TelegramClient` on two different places.\r\n\r\n### Compatibility breaks\r\n* `.create_new_connection()` is gone for good. No need to deal with this manually since new connections are now handled on demand by the library itself.\r\n\r\n### Bugs fixed\r\n* `.log_out()` was consuming all retries. It should work just fine now.\r\n* The session would fail to load if the `auth_key` had been removed manually.\r\n* `Updates.check_error` was popping wrong side, although it's been completely removed.\r\n* `ServerError`'s will be **ignored**, and the request will immediately be retried.\r\n* Cross-thread safety when saving the session file.\r\n* Some things changed on a matter of when to reconnect, so please report any bugs!\r\n\r\n### Internal changes\r\n* `TelegramClient` is now only an abstraction over the `TelegramBareClient`, which can only do basic things, such as invoking requests, working with files, etc. If you don't need any of the abstractions the `TelegramClient`, you can now use the `TelegramBareClient` in a much more comfortable way.\r\n* `MtProtoSender` is not thread-safe, but it doesn't need to be since a new connection will be spawned when needed.\r\n* New connections used to be cached and then reused. Now only their sessions are saved, as temporary connections are spawned only when needed.\r\n* Added more RPC errors to the list.\r\n\r\n**[1]:** Broken due to a condition which should had been the opposite (sigh), fixed 4 commits ahead on https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/62ea77cbeac7c42bfac85aa8766a1b5b35e3a76c.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**That's pretty much it**, although there's more work to be done to make the overall experience of working with updates *even better*. Stay tuned!"}

Also, a **second thread** will *always* be started when you connect a `TelegramClient`, despite whether you'll be handling updates or ignoring them, whose sole purpose is to constantly read from the network.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this change is as simple as *\"reading and writing shouldn't be related\"*. Even when you're simply ignoring updates, this way, once you send a request you will only need to read the result for the request. Whatever Telegram sent before has already been read and outside the buffer.\r\n\r\n## Additions\r\n* The mentioned different connection modes, and a new thread.\r\n* You can modify the `Session` attributes through the `TelegramClient` constructor (using `**kwargs`).\r\n* `RPCError`'s now belong to some request you've made, which makes more sense.\r\n* `get_input_*` now handles `None` (default) parameters more gracefully (it used to crash).\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n* The low-level socket doesn't use a handcrafted timeout anymore, which should benefit by avoiding the arbitrary `sleep(0.1)` that there used to be.\r\n* `TelegramClient.sign_in` will call `.send_code_request` if no `code` was provided.\r\n\r\n## Deprecation:\r\n* `.sign_up` does *not* take a `phone` argument anymore. Change this or you will be using `phone` as `code`, and it will fail! The definition looks like `def sign_up(self, code, first_name, last_name='')`.\r\n* The old `JsonSession` finally replaces the original `Session` (which used pickle). If you were overriding any of these, you should only worry about overriding `Session` now."}

It's also important to note that the **order** of the parameters has been **swapped**: first to *who* you want to send it, then the file itself.\r\n\r\n* The same applies to `.download_msg_media()`, which has been renamed to `.download_media()`. The method now supports a `Message` itself too, rather than only `Message.media`. The specialized `.download_photo()`, `.download_document()` and `.download_contact()` still exist, but are private.\r\n\r\n## More new stuff\r\n* Updated to **layer 70**!\r\n* Both downloading and uploading now support **stream-like objects**.\r\n* A lot **faster initial connection** if `sympy` is installed (can be installed through `pip`).\r\n* `libssl` will also be used if available on your system (likely on Linux based systems). This speed boost should also apply to uploading and downloading files.\r\n* You can use a **phone number** or an **username** for methods like `.send_message()`, `.send_file()`, and all the other quick-access methods provided by the `TelegramClient`.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Crashing when migrating to a new layer and receiving old updates should not happen now.\r\n* `InputPeerChannel` is now casted to `InputChannel` automtically too.\r\n* `.get_new_msg_id()` should now be thread-safe. No promises.\r\n* Logging out on macOS caused a crash, which should be gone now.\r\n* More checks to ensure that the connection is flagged correctly as either connected or not.\r\n\r\n## Bug additions\r\n* Downloading files from CDN's will **not work** yet (something new that comes with layer 70).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThat's it, any new idea or suggestion about how to make the project even more friendly is highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nP.S.: Did you know that you can pretty print any result Telegram returns (called `TLObject`'s) by using their `.stringify()` function? Great for debugging!"}

This will return the previously mentioned `TelegramBareClient` already connected.\r\n* Any file object can now be used to download a file (for instance, a `BytesIO()` instead a file name).\r\n* Vales like `random_id` are now **automatically inferred**, so you can save yourself from the hassle of writing `generate_random_long()` everywhere. Same applies to `.get_input_peer()`, unless you really need the extra performance provided by skipping one `if` if called manually.\r\n* Every type now features a new `.to_dict()` method.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Received errors are acknowledged to the server, so they don't happen over and over.\r\n* Downloading media on different data centers is now up to **x2 faster**, since there used to be an `InvalidDCError` for each file part tried to be downloaded.\r\n* Lost messages are now properly skipped.\r\n* New way to handle the **result of requests**. The old `ValueError` \"*The previously sent request must be resent. However, no request was previously sent (possibly called from a different thread).*\" *should* not happen anymore.\r\n\r\n## Minor highlights\r\n* Some fixes to the `JsonSession`.\r\n* Fixed possibly crashes if trying to `.invoke()` a `Request` while `.reconnect()` was being called on the `UpdatesThread`.\r\n* Some improvements on the `TcpClient`, such as not switching between blocking and non-blocking sockets.\r\n* The code now uses ASCII characters only.\r\n* Some enhancements to `.find_user_or_chat()` and `.get_input_peer()`."}
