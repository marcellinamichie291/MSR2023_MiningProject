Some of these changes may require modifications to existing user code and, in addition, some default settings have changed that may affect the appearance of plots or operation of certain functions.  \r\n\r\nSignificant new additions including improvements in the I/O systems modules that allow automatic interconnection of signals having the same name (via the `interconnect` function), generation and plotting of describing functions for closed loop systems with static nonlinearities, and a new optimal control module that allows basic computation of optimal controls (including model predictive controllers).  Some of the changes that may break use code include the deprecation of the NumPy `matrix` type (2D NumPy arrays are used instead), changes in the return value for Nyquist plots (now returns number of encirclements rather than the frequency response), switching the default timebase of systems to be 0 rather than `None` (no timebase), and changes in the processing of return values for time and frequency responses (to make them more consistent).  In many cases, the earlier behavior can be restored by calling `use_legacy_defaults('0.8.4')`.
