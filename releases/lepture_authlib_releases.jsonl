Thanks for the early contributors.\r\n\r\n- Allow Flask OAuth register `fetch_token` and `update_token`.\r\n- Bug fix for OAuthClient when `refresh_token_params` is None via [PR#14](https://github.com/lepture/authlib/pull/14).\r\n- Don\u2019t pass everything in request args for Flask OAuth client via [issue#16](https://github.com/lepture/authlib/issues/16).\r\n- Bug fix for `IDToken.validate_exp` via [issue#17](https://github.com/lepture/authlib/issues/17)."}
