Any package or ts4script files will continue to be placed under `The Sims 4/Mods`!\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n## New\r\n- New DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)\r\n  - `CommonOutfit`, this can be used to store information related to the outfit of a Sim.\r\n- New enums:\r\n  - `CommonBodySlot` - This can be used in place of BodyType.\r\n  - `CommonRegionId` - A collection of identifiers for Regions.\r\n- Scarecrow Support:\r\n  - New Sim Types available for Scarecrows\r\n  - New `CommonOccultType` value `SCARECROW`\r\n  - New functions added for checking if Sims are scarecrows as well as adding and removing the Scarecrow occult to/from Sims.\r\n  - Updated the `s4clib.add_occult` and `s4clib.remove_occult` commands to add/remove Scarecrow.\r\n- New Utilities:\r\n  - `CommonSimSpellUtils` - A utility for manipulating Spells and also the spell book of Sims.\r\n    - Commands are now available for adding and removing spells.\r\n  - `CommonSimBucksUtils` - A utility for manipulating various bucks types of Sims, such as perk points, credits, spell points, life points, etc.\r\n    - Commands are now available for modifying the number of perk points, spell points, etc. of Sims.\r\n  - `CommonSimUnlockUtils` - A utility used for manipulating unlocks of Sims.\r\n  - `CommonSimDeathUtils` - Various utilities for manipulating the death/life of Sims.\r\n    - Commands are now available for killing and reviving Sims.\r\n    - When killing Sims via the console commands (Particularly via Murphy Bed, Cow Plant, or Vending Machine), appropriate objects will now be spawned to kill them with. (Killing them with a murphy bed will spawn a murphy bed so they can kill themselves with it)\r\n      - These objects should despawn automatically after one Sim hour.\r\n- New Events:\r\n  - Sim Died\r\n  - Sim Revived\r\n  - Sim Despawned\r\n- New Commands:\r\n  - Advancing Time. `s4clib.advance_time`\r\n- New Localized Strings:\r\n  - Sim Cannot Reach Sim\r\n  - Sim Already Has This Trait\r\n  - Sim Does Not Have This Trait\r\n  - Not Implemented\r\n\r\n## Updates:\r\n- Updated how `CommonAgeUtils.get_total_days_to_age_up` functions for the High School Years patch.\r\n- Renamed `CommonFundType` to `CommonFundsSource`. `CommonFundType` is now obsolete, please use `CommonFundsSource`.\r\n- Added new keyword argument `return_type` to various functions for specifying what the expected returned type should be, this can be useful to get PyCharm Type Hinting to not complain at you so much. It serves no functional aspect in the code however, simply used for type hinting.\r\n- Many functions within `CommonFunctionUtils` will now accept additional types `CommonTestResult` and `CommonExecutionResult` to make the type hinting in PyCharm happy.\r\n- Fixed a bug with the `CommonCASUtils.detach_cas_parts_from_all_outfits_of_sim` where it was not detaching CAS Parts in some cases.\r\n- Fixed a bug with the `CommonCASUtils.attach_cas_parts_to_all_outfits_of_sim` where it was not attaching CAS Parts in some cases.\r\n- Fixed an error that could occur within `CommonItemQueryRegistry` after enabling the verbose log and trying to query for items.\r\n- Updated a few places to use the new `CommonBodySlot` enum.\r\n- Added a function to `CommonOccultUtils` for quickly determining if the Occult Type of a Sim or an Occult Type utilize a full body outfit to change their appearance, such as Skeletons (Skeleton body), Robots (Robot Body Frame), and Scarecrows (Scarecrow Body)\r\n- When the witch occult is removed via the `remove_witch_occult` function, witch spells, witch perks, and witch perk points are also removed\r\n- When werewolf occult is removed via the `remove_werewolf_occult` function, werewolf perks and werewolf perk points are removed.\r\n- When vampire occult is removed via the `remove_vampire_occult` function, vampire weakness and power perks and perk points are removed.\r\n- New functions for retrieving the Current Region, checking the Current Region, and loading Regions by GUIDs. `CommonLocationUtils`\r\n- New function for converting hex32 values to strings while keeping any leading or trailing zeros. `CommonTextUtils`\r\n- New function for truncating decimal values by a number of places for string display. `CommonTextUtils`\r\n- New function for converting seconds to milliseconds. `CommonTimeUtils`\r\n- Added functions to `CommonStopWatch` to retrieve its time in milliseconds rather than seconds.\r\n- Added functions to retrieve and set the Sexual Orientation of Sims (Is Exploring Sexuality, Is Interested In Romance/Woohoo With)\r\n- Added a few functions for checking permissions of Sims for various vanilla actions, such as changing to nude, being able to have romantic relationships, and being able to start pregnancies.\r\n- Added functions to remove interactions from the Terrain or from the Ocean. `CommonObjectInteractionUtils`\r\n- Updated `has_buff`, `has_any_buffs`, and `has_all_buffs` to better handle `SimInfoBaseWrapper`\r\n- Updated `has_trait`, `has_any_traits`, and `has_all_traits` to better handle `SimInfoBaseWrapper`\r\n- S4CL will now create or assign a bassinet to Baby Sims spawned via the `CommonSimSpawnUtils.spawn_sim` function.\r\n- Changed `get_romance_relationship_track` and `get_friendship_relationship_track` into class methods instead of static methods.\r\n- `CommonRelationshipUtils.get_romance_level` and `CommonRelationshipUtils.get_friendship_level` will now return 0.0 instead of -1.0 when romance/friendship tracks are not found between the Sims.\r\n- Increased the performance of the `has_trait`, `has_any_traits`, `has_all_traits`, `has_buff`, `has_any_buffs`, and `has_all_buffs` functions of `CommonTraitUtils` and `CommonBuffUtils`\r\n- Added a way to see times between logs for vanilla logging. This can help determine interaction performance.\r\n- The time taken by interactions is now logged in milliseconds instead of seconds for an easier time distinguishing how long functions take.\r\n- In all places where we were logging an amount of seconds, it is now logged in milliseconds instead.\r\n  - This applies to interactions, as well as the query system.\r\n- Whenever a mod registers their logs the first time, their mod versions will now be logged to their respective log files for easy reference.\r\n- Reordered many of the inherited Generic classes by putting the Generic inheritance at the end of the inheritance list, this will hopefully let the PyCharm Type Hinting be less confused about it.\r\n- Updated the S4CL phone icon to match how other phone icons look."}

Fixed an error when converting a Location to a `CommonLocation` where the `parent_ref` did not have a `provided_routing_surface` property\r\n- Fixed an issue where the Cheat menu would be visible without Cheats being enabled when holding the SHIFT key.\r\n- Fixed an issue with interactions not having proper visible names when printing them in the notification\r\n- Fixed an issue when cancelling all running interactions and the Sim adds something to their queue during that.\r\n- Fixed an issue when inducing labor in Male sims where they would not properly be able to give birth.\r\n- Fixed an issue with `CommonSimSpawnUtils` not appearing in the docs\r\n- Fixed an issue with the `CommonAlarmUtils` module not rendering in the docs due to an error\r\n- Fixed an issue with `CommonTraitUtils.has_all_traits` where it was instead checking for ANY traits.\r\n- Updated the `Purchase Objects` dialog to account for the MAIL delivery option having been deleted by EA awhile back.\r\n- Fixed an issue within `CommonSimTypeUtils.get_all_sim_types_gen` where it would return a \"human\" form for Robot Sims, when Robot Sims do not have a \"human\" form!\r\n- Fixed an issue when retrieving the short name of an interaction for interactions without a short name\r\n- Fixed an issue with the `CommonSituationUtils.get_situation_id` function where it was retrieving the `guid64` value instead of the expected `id` value for Situations.\r\n- Fixed an error that could occur when retrieving the statistic value of a Sim without a Statistic Component.\r\n- Fixed an error with the test dialog of `Choose Outfit Dialog`\r\n- Fixed an issue with interactions being registered to Ocean targets twice.\r\n- Fixed a long standing annoyance to those using S4CL and Wicked Whims together where the Toggle Phone Silence button would not be available due to a bug that exists in Wicked Whims where it flags the Toggle Phone Silence button as a CHEAT.\r\n- Fixed various issues with `CommonSuperInteraction`, `CommonSocialSuperInteraction`, `CommonSocialMixerInteraction`, `CommonMixerInteraction`, `CommonInteraction`, and `CommonTerrainInteraction`.\r\n  - **This unfortunately may lead to some weirdness in mods that have interactions containing things they didn't realize were in there (Because they were not working previously)**\r\n- Fixed an error that would occur when running commands such as `s4clib.remove_trait`, `s4clib.remove_buff`, etc.\r\n- Fixed an issue with Checkboxes in dialogs not properly displaying the correct image\r\n- Fixed an issue with custom interactions

`CommonLocalizationUtils.create_localized_string`\r\n\r\n# Additions\r\n- S4CL now has a Help command `sims4communitylib.help`, which can also be used as `sims4communitylib.help command_name` to get further details about a command.\r\n- Added a check for when a mod provides no name for their interaction.\r\n- Added `MISSING_IMAGE_ICON` to `CommonIconId`\r\n- Added Yellow and Orange colors for colorizing text with. These colors may not work for everyone.\r\n- Added the ability to decide whether or not to create a `combined.json` file in persistence.\r\n- Added a custom Console Command called `CommonConsoleCommand`, which can be used to create commands while also providing a \"help\" command for your mod that will display all currently registered commands! `<mod_name>.help`\r\n  - Commands can also be excluded from the `<mod_name>.help` command if you wish.\r\n  - This class will properly parse custom argument types such as `SimInfo`, `GameObject`, `CommonInt`, and `CommonIntFlags`, without needing to do all the extra work of parsing an id or a string yourself.\r\n  - These custom commands can also handle quotation surrounded values, so you can enter as many spaces as you want in a command. For example, you can do this command `s4clib.set_first_name \"Mr. Fantastic Of The Highest Order\"` and the first name of your Sim will then become \"Mr. Fantastic Of The Highest Order\".\r\n  - Added custom parameter classes for specifying required or optional Sim Info or Game Object arguments for `CommonConsoleCommand`\r\n    - `CommonRequiredSimInfoConsoleCommandParameter` - This will parse `sim_info: SimInfo` arguments.\r\n    - `CommonOptionalSimInfoConsoleCommandParameter` - This will parse `sim_info: SimInfo=None` arguments.\r\n    - `CommonRequiredGameObjectConsoleCommandParameter` - This will parse `game_object: GameObject` arguments.\r\n- Added strings to the string tables and to `CommonStringId` for the following uses\r\n  - String Colon Space String  - `one: two`\r\n  - String Comma Space String - `one, two`\r\n  - String Space String - `one two`\r\n  - String Space Parenthesis Surrounded String - `one (two)`\r\n  - String Newline String - `one\\ntwo`\r\n  - String Hyphen String - `one-two`\r\n- Added `CommonVisualEffect` which can be used to display various visual effects.\r\n  - Added new commands to add visual effects to Sims and objects. `s4clib.play_visual_effect` and `s4clib.stop_all_visual_effects`\r\n- Added the ability to combine strings using separators within `CommonLocalizationUtils`\r\n- New enum type `CommonIntFlags`, this can be used to create enums that are bitwise capable!\r\n  - Also added commands to show `s4clib.show_plumbob` or hide `s4clib.hide_plumbob` the plumbob above a Sims head.\r\n- Added commands to set the gender preferences of all Sims or those of a specific gender. `s4clib.set_gender_pref_of_all_sims`, `s4clib.set_gender_pref_of_all_female_sims`, and `s4clib.set_gender_pref_of_all_male_sims`\r\n- Added commands to set the first name, last name, and full name of Sims. `s4clib.set_first_name`, `s4clib.set_last_name`, and `s4clib.set_name`\r\n- Added many new trait ids to `CommonTraitId`\r\n- Added a service for cloning and modifying the clone Sim in CAS, thus allowing for a Mod author to \"prompt\" the player to choose a CAS Part or multiple CAS Parts. `CommonEditSimCloneInCASService`\r\n- Added a custom appearance modifier for applying CAS Parts to Sims. This will allow for dynamically applying Appearance Modifiers to Sims via Buffs or in other ways. `CommonAttachCASPartsAppearanceModifier`\r\n  - A custom buff for displaying bare feet has been added as an example for doing this with the `s4clib_testing.toggle_example_appearance_modifier_buff` command\r\n- Created class `CommonCASPart` that allows basic CAS part data and information to be stored and passed along to various things.\r\n- Added an event that triggers AFTER a Sim changes their outfit. `S4CLSimAfterSetCurrentOutfitEvent`\r\n- Added the ability to change a Sim into a plant Sim via the `s4clib.add_occult` command.\r\n- Added commands to add all occults to a Sim and another to remove all occults from a Sim (Does not add/remove Non Occult, Ghost, or Plant Sim)\r\n- Added a command to attach a CAS Part to all outfits of a Sim.\r\n- The `s4clib.is_cas_part_available` command will now display the body type of the CAS Part (If it is available)\r\n- Added hooks for overriding/adding to `get_participants` call to each interaction class.\r\n- Added a function to `CommonAgeUtils` for checking if a Sim has a specific age.\r\n- Added a function to `CommonSimBodyUtils` to retrieve the pond wading size of a Sim.\r\n- Added a function to attach a CAS Part to all outfits of a Sim to `CommonCASUtils`\r\n- Added functions for checking static commodities and retrieving pick info of interactions to `CommonInteractionUtils`\r\n- Added functions to the various Location utils to perform minor calculations.\r\n- Added functions to `CommonSimNameUtils` for creating random first and last names.\r\n- Added function `get_situation_guid` to `CommonSituationUtils` to retrieve the `guid64` value of a Situation.\r\n- Added function `CommonSimPregnancyUtils.induce_labor_in_sim`\r\n- Added functions for retrieving the `SimInfo` manager, `Game Object` manager, and other types of managers to various utilities.\r\n- Added functions to `CommonTimeUtils` for creating `TimeSpan` and `DateAndTime` objects.\r\n- Added functions to manipulate age progress of Sims to `CommonAgeUtils`\r\n- Added functions to `CommonSimSituationUtils` and `CommonSituationUtils`\r\n- Added functions to look at the lot traits of specific lots to `CommonLocationUtils`\r\n- Added functions for retrieving SimInfo manager, Game Object manager, and other types of managers\r\n- Added functions to CommonOccultUtils that allow you to check the availability of Occult types.\r\n- Added the ability to specify allowing the current outfit to be selected when using `CommonChooseOutfitDialog`\r\n- Created `CommonExecutionResult` to be able to provide more information when execution of a function has failed, rather than just having True or False.\r\n  - This class can also be used to decide the success/failure of the result separately from the result itself.\r\n  - The result argument of `CommonExecutionResult` can be set to a non bool value. This allows `CommonExecutionResult` to be used for values that are not just booleans.\r\n- Created `CommonTestResult` to be used as a `bool only` representation of `CommonExecutionResult`.\r\n  - It is recommended that you return this when running functions that test things to allow tooltips and provide reasons for the True/False result.\r\n- Added new utilities:\r\n  - Camera - Manipulating the camera or focus it on things. `CommonCameraUtils`\r\n  - Appearance Modifiers - Manipulating Appearance Modifiers. `CommonSimAppearanceModifierUtils`\r\n  - Game Client -  Access the game client object and do things with it. `CommonGameClientUtils`\r\n  - Plumbob - Change visibility of plumbobs on Sims. `CommonSimPlumbobUtils`.\r\n  - Object Slots - Access container slots on objects. `CommonObjectSlotUtils`\r\n  - Object States - Manipulate object states. `CommonObjectStateUtils`\r\n  - Sim Routing - Do things related to routing for Sims. `CommonSimRoutingUtils`\r\n  - Careers - Do things with careers or do things career related for Sims. \r\n    - `CommonCareerUtils`\r\n    - `CommonSimCareerUtils`\r\n  - Career Tracks - Manipulate career tracks. `CommonCareerTrackUtils`\r\n  - Career Levels - Manipulate career levels. `CommonCareerLevelUtils`\r\n  - Game Packs - Check and retrieve available game packs. `CommonGamePackUtils`\r\n  - Currency Modifications - Modify various currency types (currently only Simoleons) `CommonSimCurrencyUtils`\r\n  - Rabbit Holes - Put Sims into a rabbit hole while they \"do something\" `CommonSimRabbitHoleUtils`\r\n  - Terrain - Manipulate various aspects of the Terrain.\r\n    - `CommonTerrainInteractionUtils`\r\n    - `CommonTerrainLocationUtils`\r\n    - `CommonTerrainUtils`\r\n- Added new classes:\r\n  - Tunable Object Filters - Filter through objects. `CommonMatchAllNonSimsObjectFilter`, `CommonMatchAllSimsObjectFilter`\r\n  - Comparison classes - Classes that can be passed into functions that may be used to compare integers.\r\n    - `CommonComparisonEqualTo`\r\n    - `CommonComparisonGreaterThan`\r\n    - `CommonComparisonLessThan`\r\n    - `CommonComparisonGreaterThanOrEqualTo`\r\n    - `CommonComparisonLessThanOrEqualTo`\r\n- Added some fun secret commands.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n- The test classes now require mod identity to be passed in `CommonTestService.test_class`\r\n- Tests can now be run for specific mods by their mod name\r\n- Added a version number to the names of logged files (Assuming the mod specifies a version number)\r\n- Added more details to Test Result verbose log messages in interactions to indicate which level of interaction is being called and where the result of the Test Result is returning from (Which class in particular).\r\n- When using the S4CL debug interactions, the results will now also be logged in the log file.\r\n- The \"Took # Seconds to blah\" debug messages are now only shown in the verbose log for interactions\r\n- S4CL will now catch/log way less random errors, especially vanilla ones.

It will convert them to a name and sim id instead of the usual Object base class.\r\n- Updated `CommonSimUtils` to be able to handle `SimInfoBaseWrapper` objects\r\n- The `S4CLSimChangedOccultTypeEvent` will now occur after the Sim actually switches to the occult.\r\n- `s4clib.print_*_outfit` will now print integer body types that are not within the `BodyType` enum\r\n- `set_age` of `CommonAgeUtils` will now properly advance/reverse the age of a Sim while applying all of the things that entails. (Homework, vampirism manifestation, school, etc.)\r\n- Added the ability to specify keyword arguments to `attach_cas_part_to_sim` and `detach_cas_part_from_sim`\r\n- Removed many new lines at the end formatted messages being logged\r\n- Changed the default value for `persist_mod_data_per_save_slot` to `False`, since save slots are way too buggy.\r\n  - This will not solve the issue for those that have the value set to True, but it should solve issues with it for any new users.\r\n- Updated `create_unique_identifier` to not use an `eval` call.\r\n- Added assertions to prevent adding negative or None CAS Parts to `CommonSimOutfitIO`\r\n- The Sim and Object Data Storage classes use a different method of storing Sim and Object data, which supports having more than one type of them for the same Mod. This should lead to potentially solving the issue of some people getting the wrong instance for a class returned when a Mod has more than one type of Sim Data or Game Object Data classes\r\n  - Added a check to ensure the returned object is of the correct class as what is expected.\r\n  - Added a function to clear cached data from these data storages\r\n  - Instances are now cached using the Mod Name, the Class Name, and an Identifier.\r\n- Minor clean up of `CommonSimOutfitIO`, it should be more performant, with potentially less errors that may occur.\r\n- Added a new line after every test log message when running tests.\r\n\r\n# Fixes\r\n- Fixed the Ringer icon not appearing properly in the phone menu. When using some other mods that were improperly coded, this error may continue to be a problem, but it will now no longer be S4CL causing it.\r\n- Fixed an issue where interactions would not properly register to some objects, especially proxied objects such as pool squares and ocean locations.\r\n- Fixed issues with the age value being None when checking the Age of a Sim within `CommonAgeUtils`\r\n- Fixed a potential error within `CommonSpecies` if the player does not have the Cats & Dogs DLC (Thus not having the SmallDog, LargeDog, or Cat Species values)\r\n- Fixed an error when setting a Sim to age Child from Teen or above using `CommonAgeUtils.set_age`\r\n- Fixed an error when changing progress toward the next level where it was setting the progress toward max level instead.\r\n- Fixed a few issues when checking whether a Sim is currently a mermaid or not.\r\n- Fixed an error when determining if a Sim has an occult type\r\n- Fixed an error when clicking on Sims in the relationship panel with the new Cottage Living patch (July 20th, 2021)\r\n- Fixed an error that would occur when opening a `CommonPurchasePickerDialog` with the new Cottage Living patch (July 20th, 2021)\r\n\r\n# Project Changes:\r\n- Added a gitattributes file\r\n- Updated the gitignore of the project\r\n- Updated the compile and decompile scripts of the project\r\n- Marked Utilities as a Sources root for the project"}

Skill levels are now properly set on Sims in most scenarios.\r\n\r\n# Updates/Changes\r\n- Added an `INVALID` value for many Enums that may be used as a Default value.\r\n- Added a few motives that were missing from the motive utils and motive enum, such as Servo Charge, Servo Durability, Witch Magic, and Mermaid Hydration (Which is really just Hygiene)\r\n- Update `CommonSkillId` to include skills that were missing\r\n- CommonInt instances are now convertable to and comparible with Integers naturally.

Error messages should now contain the name of the Interaction that is throwing errors and will hopefully help when debugging seemingly generic errors in the future.\r\n- Updated various places to use the wrapping classes. (CommonLocation, CommonVector3, etc.) (They are still considered of their respective types i.e. CommonLocation is still a Location and CommonVector3 is still a Vector3.)\r\n- `CommonLocalizationUtils.create_localized_string` can now handle instances of `TunableLocalizedStringFactory._Wrapper`.\r\n- Updated the type hints inside all of the Custom Interactions by adding the `Timeline` type to the `timeline` argument.\r\n- CommonObjectSpawnUtils:\r\n  - Added `kwargs` argument to `destroy_object`\r\n  - Updated docstrings in a few places\r\n  - Fixed the type hints incorrectly using Vector3 instead of Location for location arguments.\r\n- CommonSimSpawnUtils:\r\n  - Changed the default value for `first_name` and `last_name` in `create_human_sim_info` to an empty string\r\n  - Updated docstrings in a few places\r\n  - Added `kwargs` argument to `spawn_sim`\r\n  - Added `kwargs` argument to `spawn_sim_at_active_sim_location`\r\n  - `spawn_sim_at_active_sim_location` will now use the position of the active Sims if their location is not found.\r\n  - Added `source` and `kwargs` arguments to `despawn_sim`\r\n  - Added `source` and `kwargs` arguments to `delete_sim`\r\n- CommonPregnancyUtils:\r\n  - Added a `pregnancy_origin` argument to `start_pregnancy`\r\n- CommonObjectUtils:\r\n  - Fixed an error in `get_object_id` where it would sometimes return None instead of -1 as it should.\r\n- CommonSimLocationUtils:\r\n  - Fixed an error thrown when checking if a Sim is at home when they have been despawned or not loaded.\r\n  - `is_at_home` now also checks the on_home_lot property of a Sim and also checks to see if the Sim actually has a household.\r\n- CommonObjectLocationUtils:\r\n  - Fixed the type hints of `get_location` and `set_location` incorrectly using Vector3 when they should have been using Location.\r\n  - Fixed the type hints of `get_position` incorrectly using ScriptObject when it should have been using GameObject.\r\n- CommonLocationUtils:\r\n  - Fixed an issue with `get_current_lot_id` returning the current zone id when it should have been returning the current lot id.\r\n- CommonHouseholdUtils:\r\n  - Fixed an issue with `get_household_lot_id` returning the zone id when it should have been returning the lot id.\r\n- CommonInteraction:\r\n  - Improved the error handling `_test` and changed it to use the get_mod_identity function.\r\n  - `create_test_result` is now a classmethod instead of a static method to make use of the Mod Identity\r\n- CommonSuperInteraction:\r\n  - Fixed the example in the class docstring mistakenly using `on_started` instead of `on_run`\r\n- CommonConstrainedSuperInteraction:\r\n  - Added a class log and mod identity.\r\n- CommonSimInteractionUtils:\r\n  - `get_stand_interaction` and `get_swim_interaction` now return -1 instead of None when a suitable interaction is not found for a Sim.\r\n\r\n## New:\r\n### Interactions:\r\n- Induce Labor - Now you can force your Sim to go into labor!
