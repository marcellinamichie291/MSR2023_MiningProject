This model can be used by setting the config argument `model: arlstm`. Please refer to the [documentation](https://neuralhydrology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/models.html#model-classes) about specific requirements of this model.\r\n  - Added an option `random_holdout_from_dynamic_features` to the config that applies dropout on the time series features by sampling two Bernoulli processes with different rate parameters. This is used for training the `arlstm` to simulate missing (autoregressive) inputs already during training, which are then replaced by the model outputs of previous timesteps.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n- A bug when writing the metrics.csv file during validation if the first basin (in the basin list) has no validation data."}

This PR removes the pickle dependencies and from now on, the scaler (used or normalization) and basin-id-to-integer dictionaries (in case of using basin-one-hot-encoding) are stored in YAML files. However, the old format is still supported so that old runs can still be used. \r\n\r\n## Additionally\r\n- Updates of the description of the config argument `metrics` and `clip_targets_to_zero`"}

The biggest addition are the newly added uncertainty heads that are now available for all models. That is, it is now possible to train any of the implemented models with probabilistic model heads. For details on these probabilistic model heads, see [Klotz et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14295). The uncertainty heads support all models, also the multi-frequency models like `MTS-LSTM`. The only limitation so far are multi-targets (per-frequency), which is currently not supported but will be added within the next days/weeks. We also plan to release a tutorial around the uncertainty heads soon.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n- The optional embedding of static and dynamic inputs was re-implemented and made more flexible for possible extensions in the future. It is now possible to specify distinct architectures for dynamic and static input embeddings. The config arguments `statics/dynamics_embedding` should now be dictionaries with keys 'type', 'hiddens', 'activation', 'dropout' or None (no embedding). The old way of specifying embeddings via `embedding_hiddens` etc. still works but is deprecated.\r\n- The config argument `lagged_features` does now accept a list of integers (as well as just an integer like before) to specify multiple lagged copies of a single feature. \r\n- The warning message of the  metric functions does now include the basin id, if all simulations or observations are NaN, to facilitate the inspection of eventual problems with the model/data.\r\n- Different model heads for uncertainty estimation (see the corresponding publication by [Klotz et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14295)). It is now possible to combine any model with different heads (config argument `head`, see [Config arguments](https://neuralhydrology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/config.html)), instead of before only `regression`. The new heads are `cmal`, `umal`, `gmm` (see the linked publication for more details). All heads require special loss functions that are also provided and all models now have a sample function for the different head (e.g. `model.sample_cmal()` for a model trained with CMAL head), to sample from the (trained) model. There are also a couple of new config arguments that are required/optional for those heads, so make sure to checkout the specific sections in the [Documentation](https://neuralhydrology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/config.html)\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n- Missing `raise` in the `dump_config` method of the `Config` class, if the file already exists.\r\n- Problem, when evaluating the validation period outside of the model training process with `log_n_figures` > 0 in the config\r\n- Problem in `continue-training` mode, when specifying `device` as special input argument\r\n"}
