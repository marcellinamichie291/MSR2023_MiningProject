It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies)\r\n\r\n* Compute shader support. `WindowConfig.load_compute_shader` and added `compute_shader` parameter for `ProgramDescription`.\r\n* Shaders now support `#include` up to a maximum of 100 levels\r\n* Added support for gif anim. This can be loaded as a `Texture` or `TextureArray`\r\n* Added support for loading cube maps\r\n* `WindowConfig.run()` shortcut\r\n* Each window backend now has a `name` property so the user can easily detect what window type they are given\r\n* `WindowConfig` now as a `vsync` property so the user can easily control this from python code\r\n* Scene: New methods to find materials and node by name\r\n\r\nSlightly Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* All windows now use 0 samples (MSAA) by default. The default `samples = 4` caused way too much issues\r\n  for people with older integrated gpus and when doing headless rendering when multisampling is not supported.\r\n\r\nBug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixed several issues with glft2 scenes and object orientation\r\n* pyglet window: Fixed incorrect mouse position on retina screens and windows\r\n  with pixel ratio > 1.\r\n* sdl2: mouse press/release events was reversed\r\n* pygame2: Fix broken mouse wheel reading\r\n* glfw: Incorrect mapping of BACKSPACE key\r\n* glfw: Fixed an issue not setting vsync properly\u00a8\r\n* headless: We now call `ctx.finish()` in `swap_buffers`\r\n* Shader errors should now report the error line more accurately\r\n* Various typo fixes"}
