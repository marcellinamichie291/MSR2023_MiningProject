The first **2.0 pre-release** is planned to release soon, there is no point in quickly putting out 1.8.\r\n\r\n**Well, then... why are you making this pre-release?**\r\nI am just making this pre-release, because I have fixed a few critical bugs. \r\nThis is just for the users that want a quick fix to some issues they were encountering as they wait for 2.0 to come out.\r\n\r\n**Will you still provide support for packetevents 1.8 once 2.0 comes out?**\r\nNo. As soon as a pre-release for 2.0 comes out, I will not provide support for packetevents 1.8.\r\n***But***, *I will help anyone that needs help migrating from an older version of packetevents to 2.0.*\r\n\r\n### Shading packetevents\r\n\r\nIf you are shading PacketEvents, you need to soft-depend ProtocolLib, ViaVersion, ProtocolSupport and Geyser-Spigot in your plugin.\r\nExample plugin.yml\r\n```yml\r\nname: myplugin\r\nversion: 1.0.0\r\nmain: me.opdeveloper.myplugin.MainClass\r\nauthor: myname\r\nsoftdepend:\r\n  - ProtocolLib\r\n  - ProtocolSupport\r\n  - ViaVersion\r\n  - Geyser-Spigot\r\n```\r\n\r\n### API CHANGES\r\n* WrappedPacketInCustomPayload#getTag -> WrappedPacketInCustomPayload#getChannelName;\r\n* WrappedPacketOutCustomPayload#getTag -> WrappedPacketOutCustomPayload#getChannelName;\r\n* WrappedPacketLoginOutCustomPayload#getTag -> WrappedPacketLoginOutCustomPayload#getChannelName;\r\nThe channel names in the wrappers above now also contains the namespace on newer server versions, it can be \"minecraft:brand\" on newer server versions instead of just \"brand\". Older versions such as 1.8 always had the namespace. I just made the names consistent. This is a sort of breaking change, that is why I didn't end up deprecating getTag, i want you guys to be aware of the breaking change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BUG FIXES\r\n* FIxed flying packet on 1.17 and added support for GROUND packet, thanks @MWHunter\r\n* Fixed WrappedPacketOutEntityDestroy for 1.17.1\r\n* Fix ServerVersion comparison, thanks @MWHunter \r\n* Fixed sending WrappedPacketOutPosition for 1.9 -> 1.16.5\r\n* ViaVersion API usage for newer ViaVersion releases fixed (they deprecated their old API)\r\n* Removed invalid/redundant enum constants in ServerVersion\r\n* ServerUtils#getEntityById bug fixes\r\n* Fixed a bug with cancelling events.\r\n\r\n### NEW FEATURES\r\n* Added/Tested 1.17.1 support\r\n* WrappedPacketOutCollect created, thanks @Tecnio\r\n* WrappedPacketInUseItem created, thanks @MWHunter \r\n* WrappedPacketOutSpawnEntity created\r\n* WrappedPacketLoginOutCustomPayload is now sendable\r\n* Copied Bukkit's BoundingBox util, please use ours, because Bukkit's util doesn't exist on older server versions\r\n* ServerUtils#getEntityBoundingBox created\r\n* NPC#teleport created\r\n* PlayerUtils#writePacket and PlayerUtils#flushPackets created\r\n\r\n### EXAMPLE USAGE\r\n*Example will be posted shortly*", "mentions_count": 2}

(if you are shading PacketEvents)\r\n* You are recommended to make your plugin load at server STARTUP, not POSTWORLD. \r\nExample plugin.yml\r\n```yml\r\nname: plugin-name\r\nversion: 1.0.0\r\nmain: package.MainClass\r\nload: STARTUP\r\nauthor: username\r\nsoftdepend:\r\n  - ProtocolLib\r\n  - ProtocolSupport\r\n  - ViaVersion\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BUG FIXES\r\n* Pretty rare ConcurrentModificationExceptions when accessing an Entity in a wrapper. \r\n* Reloading support added(NOT RECOMMENDED)\r\n\r\n### NEW FEATURES\r\n* PacketEvents ASYNCHRONOUS loading. You can now load asynchronously.\r\n```java\r\nPacketEvents#loadAsync(ExecutorService)\r\n```\r\nor \r\n```java\r\nPacketEvents#loadAsyncNewThread()\r\n```\r\n* Most wrappers that contain an Entity getter, will now have a second Entity getter, but with a World argument. This can potentially allow faster entity resolving. If the entity wasn't found in the specified world, it will be searched for in all other worlds.\r\nFor example:\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic void onPacketPlayReceive(PacketPlayReceiveEvent event) {\r\n    Player player = event.getPlayer();\r\n    byte packetID = event.getPacketId();\r\n    if (packetID == PacketType.Play.Client.USE_ENTITY) {\r\n       WrappedPacketInUseEntity useEntity = new WrappedPacketInUseEntity(event.getNMSPacket());\r\n       Entity entity = useEntity.getEntity(player.getWorld());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* WrappedPacketOutBlockBreakAnimation created\r\n* WrappedPacketOutUpdateAttributes created\r\n\r\n### CHANGES\r\n* PacketType IDs in different states will never have the same value. For example if you accidentally use a PacketType.Status ID on a Play event, you shouldn't get weird results. Nothing will call. Each ID is unique. Do not try to hardcode the ID values, use the variables. \r\n\r\n### EXAMPLE USAGE\r\n[Example for packetevents-1.8-pre-7](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents-example/tree/3614f9c17f4b43afa1b105a8bdbae0fd76dd1781)"}

This would usually occur when users join while the server is starting. We have FIXED this. We will schedule a re-injection a bit later(one second), and with our testing, it seems to work! You are now able to configure the action PacketEvents should do when the re-injection fails(should never be the case, unless there are incompatibilities). By default PacketEvents will kick the user. \r\nExample of how to modify the action: https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents-example/blob/master/src/main/java/Main.java#L35\r\n\r\n### NEW FEATURES\r\n* WrappedPacketOutChat(BaseComponent, UUID) constructor added.\r\n* WrappedPacketOutNamedSoundEffect wrapper finished(NOT sendable yet).\r\n* WrappedPacketInBlockPlace#getCursorX, WrappedPacketInBlockPlace#getCursorY, WrappedPacketInBlockPlace#getCursorZ added by @Tecnio\r\n**WARNING:** These methods are only supported on 1.7.10 up to 1.8.8 versions of minecraft as newer versions no longer give us this data.\r\n*  WrappedPacketOutPosition finished, new methods added. You can now check if the values in the wrapper are relative or absolute.\r\n* You can now filter out what packets get called in your packet listener.(NOT SUPPORTED ON LEGACY EVENT SYSTEM/legacy packet listener).\r\nDoing this might noticeably improve performance of your plugin. \r\nLearn how to use this new feature by viewing this example: https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents-example/blob/master/src/main/java/Main.java#L69\r\n\r\n* PacketListenerDynamic#onPacketEventExternal added. Since the PacketListenerDynamic has a method for every in-built event. You might ask how can I use a custom event created using the PacketEvents event system. You can use the PacketListenerDynamic#onPacketEventExternal. It is only fired for external events, events that aren't built into the PacketEvents API!\r\n\r\n### OPTIMIZATIONS\r\n* WrappedPacketInEntityAction optimized and cleaned up.\r\n* ClientVersion cleaned up by @terrarier2111 \r\n\r\n### CHANGES\r\n* Direction enum import changed.\r\nDirection.OTHER is when the face is equal to 255(check wiki.vg/Protocol for more information)\r\nDirection.INVALID is when the face is not recognized. The user might be cheating or might be a new protocol change? Not sure?\r\n* PacketListenerDynamic#onPacketEvent used to be a method called for every single event, allowing you to do \"instanceof\" checks to use your target event, but this feature is useless due to how little events we have. We removed it to help improve performance, we also realized that barely anyone used this feature.\r\n\r\n### EXAMPLE USAGE\r\n[View packetevents-example source code for 1.8-pre-3](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents-example/tree/master/src/main/java)"}

We only need to finish the official guide, finish documenting the API and make sure PacketEvents 1.8 will be as bug-free as possible.\r\nWe are doing our best to have 1.8 be stable unlike most previous releases.\r\nThis is a pre release, meaning it might NOT be production ready. \r\nThank you to all users that have been frequently updating to the dev builds to help us fix all the bugs and improve the API.\r\nWe would really appreciate if you read this changelog as a lot of effort is put into our changelogs. \r\nA couple of users end up discovering new features and get surprised that they have been added many versions ago.\r\nThe changelog is a summary of the changes, we'd like to let you know that this pre release is just under 200 commits ahead of the last release! (1.7.9)\r\n\r\n### BUG FIXES\r\n* Cancelling events in the PacketListenerDynamic works again.\r\n* Internal netty early injector bug fixes.\r\n* WrappedPacketInAbilities#isFlying fixed for 1.16\r\n* Couple of ClientVersion resolving bugs fixed.\r\n\r\n### NEW FEATURES\r\n#### NEW WRAPPERS / NEW WRAPPER FEATURES\r\n* WrappedPacketInUseEntity#getHand added.\r\n* WrappedPacketOutOpenWindow added. (NOT SENDABLE)\r\n* WrappedPacketInEnchantItem added.\r\n* WrappedPacketInSpectate added.\r\n* WrappedPacketInSetCreativeSlot added by @NikV2 . \r\n* WrappedPacketInTeleportAccept added by @Tecnio .\r\n* WrappedPacketInItemName added by @Tecnio .\r\n* WrappedPacketInPickItem added by @Tecnio .\r\n* WrappedPacketInBeacon added by @Tecnio .\r\n* WrappedPacketOutChat(BaseComponent, ChatPosition, UUID) created. (support for hoverable messages in the wrapper)\r\n#### OTHER NEW FEATURES\r\n* NMSPacket class created.\r\n* ClientVersion#isPreRelease added.\r\n* PacketType.Play.Server.NAMED_ENTITY_SPAWN added by @LIWKK \r\n\r\n### OPTIMIZATIONS\r\n* Wrapper internal field caching improved.\r\n* Internal channel caching improved.\r\n* Internal packet and event processing optimized.\r\n* Dynamic wrapper loading, PacketEvents won't load every single wrapper.\r\nAs soon as you use a wrapper for the first time, that is when PacketEvents will load that wrapper.\r\nLeading to faster PacketEvents load times and lower memory usage.\r\n* Dynamic event system optimized. (WARNING, registering listeners is NOT thread safe)\r\n* Legacy event system minimally optimized (STILL unrecommended to use)\r\n* Injection system improved/optimized.\r\n* WrappedPacketOutAnimation cleaned up and optimized.\r\n\r\n### CHANGES\r\n* TinyProtocol removed, wrote my own similar injector (same approach as TinyProtocol).\r\n* PostPlayerInjectEvent is no longer always called asynchronously. PostPlayerInjectEvent#isAsync will let you know if it has been called on the main thread or not.\r\n\r\n* PacketEvents instance accessor method renamed.\r\nPacketEvents.getAPI() has been deprecated for now.\r\n```java\r\nPacketEvents.getAPI() -> PacketEvents.get()\r\n```\r\n* Added jetbrains annotations dependency with scope \"compile\" to use the Nullable and NotNull annotation.\r\n* Renaming/Refactoring...\r\n```java\r\nPacketType.Client -> PacketType.Play.Client\r\nPacketType.Server -> PacketType.Play.Server\r\n-\r\nPacketType.Login split up into:\r\nPacketType.Login.Client\r\nPacketType.Login.Server\r\n-\r\nPacketType.Status split up into:\r\nPacketType.Status.Client\r\nPacketType.Status.Server\r\n\r\nPacketReceiveEvent -> PacketPlayReceiveEvent\r\nPacketSendEvent -> PacketPlaySendEvent\r\n\r\nPacketLoginEvent -> PacketLoginReceiveEvent & PacketLoginSendEvent\r\n\r\nPacketStatusEvent -> PacketStatusReceiveEvent & PacketStatusSendEvent\r\n\r\nPacketListenerDynamic#onPacketReceive -> PacketListenerDynamic#onPacketPlayReceive\r\nPacketListenerDynamic#onPacketSend -> PacketListenerDynamic#onPacketPlaySend\r\n\r\nPacketListenerDynamic#onPacketLogin -> PacketListenerDynamic#onPacketLoginReceive & PacketListenerDynamic#onPacketLoginSend\r\n\r\nPacketListenerDynamic#onPacketStatus -> PacketListenerDynamic#onPacketStatusReceive & PacketListenerDynamic#onPacketStatusSend\r\n\r\nPacketListenerDynamic#onPostPacketReceive -> PacketListenerDynamic#onPostPacketPlayReceive\r\nPacketListenerDynamic#onPostPacketSend -> PacketListenerDynamic#onPostPacketPlaySend\r\n```\r\n**Please check the example repository linked at the very bottom, I have not listed all renames/refactors. Hopefully the example will help you, otherwise make an issue on the GitHub repository or ask in the discord server.**\r\n\r\n* Cleaned up the built-in events with better abstraction.\r\nAll events relating to packets extend NMSPacketEvent or CancellableNMSPacketEvent (depends if they support cancelling)\r\n* PacketEvents supporting multiple plugins shading the same API under ONE condition. The PacketEvents version of the plugins must be the SAME for them to be compatible and for you to avoid ClassLoader issues. \r\n* PacketEventPriority is now an enum and contains enum constants instead of byte constants.\r\nThe legacy event system still uses bytes. To access the byte value of an enum constant in the PacketEventPriority enum use the *getPriorityValue* method.\r\n* NMS Entity cache accessing fixed for mSpigot and its forks by @LIWKK . \r\n\r\n### EXAMPLE USAGE\r\n[View packetevents-example source code for 1.8-PRE-1](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents-example/blob/1b11ee33c1761f5c97bf3b3b9a044a874d1afd14/src/main/java/)"}

(Thanks to @terrarier2111)\r\n\u2022 Usage of PacketEventsSettings changed. \r\nDoing this is now possible:\r\n```java\r\nPacketEvents.getSettings().injectAsync(true).ejectAsync(true).\r\nuseProtocolLibIfAvailable(true);\r\n```\r\n\u2022 Bug in WrappedPacketInWindowClick fixed.\r\n\u2022 Cleaner errors, a few custom exceptions created(for example WrapperFieldNotFoundException) to help us spot bugs easier.\r\n\u2022 WrappedPacketInArmAnimation removed as it was just a redundant wrapper, nothing to read.\r\n\u2022 WrappedPacketOutGameStateChange \"value\" field accidentally returned the \"reason\" field.\r\n\u2022 Finding entities by their ID optimized to use less reflection calls than necessary.\r\n\u2022 WrappedPacketOutEntityMetadata created, for now only provides entity ID(so unfinished).\r\n\u2022 WrappedPacketOutEntityTeleport wrapper created, performs best on 1.7-1.8.x. \r\nNot recommended to use wrappers if it is possible with the Bukkit API as we will most likely be slower due to our reflection calls.\r\nIt is common that the required reflection calls of a field in a wrapper unfortunately increases every 3rd/4th minecraft update.\r\nSo wrappers perform best on 1.7.10 and 1.8. \r\n\u2022 WrappedPacket now supports a nice util to write to fields.\r\nUse this if a sendable wrapper you want to use does not exist yet.\r\n\u2022 All wrappers optimized to only read the fields you access with its getter method.\r\nFor example, in the flying packet, if you only need access the xyz coordinates and nothing else, PacketEvents will not use reflection calls to redundantly read the other fields.\r\n\u2022 Optimized ServerVersion enum, isHigherThan, isLowerThan.. with the ServerVersion have been optimized and are now not heavy at all, you no longer need to cache these things. (Thanks to @terrarier2111)\r\n\u2022 Netty channel accessing (even when cached) optimized. (Thanks to @terrarier2111)\r\n\u2022 Lots and lots of code cleanup. (Thanks to @terrarier2111)\r\n\u2022 PacketEvents now calculates player ping independently with Keep Alive packets(we don't send any ourselves).\r\nIf you would still like to access NMS' calculated ping, now use: \r\n```java\r\nPacketEvents.getAPI().getPlayerUtils().getNMSPing(Player);\r\n```\r\nThe NMS ping is smoothed, so if you want a value close to NMS' calculations use: \r\n```java\r\nPacketEvents.getAPI().getPlayerUtils().getSmoothedPing(Player);\r\n```\r\n\u2022 PostPacketReceiveEvent and PostPacketSendEvent created. (Not cancellable, they events assure you the relating event wasn't cancelled)\r\n\u2022 Update checking uses the same thread pool that is used to inject players, eject players, and process events.\r\n\u2022 WrappedPacketOutEntity can now be sent to players.\r\n\u2022 BungeeCord support added(Check out the Bungee version)\r\n\u2022 Vector3i utility class created\r\n\u2022 PacketEvents auto resolve client version setting removed as it may cause falses and is now unneeded.\r\n\u2022 PacketEvents now has a setting to use TinyProtocol and basically inject players earlier, so you won't need a dependency to resolve client versions.\r\n\u2022 PacketLoginEvent created\r\n\u2022 PacketStatusEvent created\r\n\u2022 WrappedGameProfile utility class created\r\n\u2022 Setting to inject earlier created(Basically if TinyProtocol should be used)\r\nTinyProtocol allegedly has bugs when users join while the server is still starting, I will double check and test.\r\n\u2022 New Setting to activate/deactivate TinyProtocol. If ViaVersion, ProtocolSupport or ProtocolLib is found, we will use their APIs to access their already resolved client version, so we don't have to. :)\r\nThis setting is enabled by default btw.\r\n```java\r\nPacketEvents.getSettings().injectEarly(boolean);\r\n```\r\n\u2022 PacketType.Login.x and PacketType.Status.x Packet IDs created.\r\n\u2022 All new login wrappers created:\r\nWrappedPacketLoginDisconnect, WrappedPacketLoginHandshake, WrappedPacketLoginInCustomPayload(roughly since 1.13.2), WrappedPacketLoginInStart, WrappedPacketLoginOutEncryptionBegin, WrappedPacketLoginInEncryptionBegin, WrappedPacketLoginOutSetCompression(roughly since 1.8), WrappedPacketLoginOutSuccess\r\n\u2022 All new status wrappers:\r\nWrappedPacketStatusPing, WrappedPacketStatusPong\r\n\u2022 The login and status event will only be triggered if you toggle on the early inject setting, as we need to inject early to listen to them.\r\n\u2022 WrappedPacketOutExplosion created and can be sent to players.\r\n\u2022 WrappedPacketOutEntityStatus created and can be sent to players.\r\n\u2022 WrappedPacketOutExperience created and supports being sent to players."}
