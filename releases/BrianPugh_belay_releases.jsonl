They don't actually impact Belay's ability to operate. Removed `SpecialFilenameError` that would have been previously raised if either of these were present.\r\n* Added optional keyword argument `keep` to specify files on-device that should not be deleted if a corresponding file doesn't exist in the sync folder.
