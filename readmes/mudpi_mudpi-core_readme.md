# MudPi Smart Automation for the Garden & Home
> A python package to gather sensor readings, trigger components, control devices and more in an event based system that can be run on a linux SBC, including Raspberry Pi.


## Documentation
For full documentation visit [mudpi.app](https://mudpi.app/docs)


## Installation
Install MudPi using the [Installer](https://github.com/mudpi/installer) that will guide you through the process. You can also view the [manual install instructions](https://github.com/mudpi/installer/blob/master/docs/MANUAL_INSTALL.md)


## Guides
For examples and guides on how to setup and use MudPi check out the [free guides available.](https://mudpi.app/guides)


## Funding
MudPi core is open source and has a bunch of free resources built around it. Being a solo developer it has become quite a lot to maintain the various areas of the project. It makes me happy seeing how MudPi has helped many people worldwide. I would like to continue working on MudPi and put even more time into the project to take on bigger ambitions. However it has come to a point that MudPi is taking more time to build with little to no income to help justify it. I really could use help from the community to continue building MudPi. If you like my work and MudPi please consider [helping me fund the project and keep the lights on.](https://www.patreon.com/mudpi) 


## Contributing
Any contributions you can make will be greatly appreciated. If you are interested in contributing please get in touch with me and submit a pull request. There is much more I would like to add support for, however being a single developer limits my scope. Therefore mainly bugs will be accepted as issues.
