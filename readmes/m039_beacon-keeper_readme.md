Beacon Keeper
=============

Beacon Keeper is a small, simple and solid library for working with iBeacons for Android. Before using it you may want to try it with [a standalone application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.m039.beacon.keeper.app).

If you need a more robust approach, you should prefer [android-beacon-library](https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library).
