Compiled JARs
=============

Make sure to [*read the
README*](https://github.com/Flowdalic/asmack/blob/master/README.asmack)
for every release! Or else aSmack won't work for you. 95% of the
problems people experiencing with aSmack come from the fact that they
didn't read the README.

The JARs can be found @ http://asmack.freakempire.de/

Please only base changes on aSmack if they are in fact aSmack
specific. Most code improvments should be done directly in Smack so
that both worlds (Java SE and Android) benefit from it.

Your code contribution must follow [Smack's contributor guidelines](
http://community.igniterealtime.org/docs/DOC-1984), be good documented
and should contain some testcases. Then you can simply join #smack @
freenode and ask for a code review.
