# Simple Stack

## Why do I want this?

To make navigation to another screen as simple as `backstack.goTo(SomeScreen())`, and going back as simple as `backstack.goBack()`.

No more `FragmentTransaction`s in random places. Predictable and customizable navigation in a single location.

## What is Simple Stack?

Simple Stack is a backstack library (or technically, a navigation framework) that allows you to represent your navigation state in a list of immutable, parcelable data classes ("keys").

This allows preserving your navigation history across configuration changes and process death - this is handled automatically.

Each screen can be associated with a scope, or a shared scope - to easily share data between screens.

This simplifies navigation and state management within an Activity using either fragments, views, or whatever else.

## Using Simple Stack

In order to use Simple Stack, you need to add `jitpack` to your project root `build.gradle.kts`
(or `build.gradle`):

``` kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // ...
        maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
    // ...
}
```

or

``` groovy
// build.gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
    // ...
}
```

In newer projects, you need to also update the `settings.gradle` file's `dependencyResolutionManagement` block:

```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }  // <--
        jcenter() // Warning: this repository is going to shut down soon
    }
}
```

and then, add the dependency to your module's `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`):

``` kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
implementation("com.github.Zhuinden:simple-stack:2.6.4")

implementation("com.github.Zhuinden.simple-stack-extensions:core-ktx:2.2.4")
implementation("com.github.Zhuinden.simple-stack-extensions:fragments:2.2.4")
implementation("com.github.Zhuinden.simple-stack-extensions:fragments-ktx:2.2.4")
implementation("com.github.Zhuinden.simple-stack-extensions:navigator-ktx:2.2.4")
implementation("com.github.Zhuinden.simple-stack-extensions:services:2.2.4")
implementation("com.github.Zhuinden.simple-stack-extensions:services-ktx:2.2.4")
```

or

``` groovy
// build.gradle
implementation 'com.github.Zhuinden:simple-stack:2.6.4'

implementation 'com.github.Zhuinden.simple-stack-extensions:core-ktx:2.2.4'
implementation 'com.github.Zhuinden.simple-stack-extensions:fragments:2.2.4'
implementation 'com.github.Zhuinden.simple-stack-extensions:fragments-ktx:2.2.4'
implementation 'com.github.Zhuinden.simple-stack-extensions:navigator-ktx:2.2.4'
implementation 'com.github.Zhuinden.simple-stack-extensions:services:2.2.4'
implementation 'com.github.Zhuinden.simple-stack-extensions:services-ktx:2.2.4'
```

## How do I use it?

You can check out [**the tutorials**](https://github.com/Zhuinden/simple-stack/tree/611e8c7db738a776156b8f709db22b8e37413221/tutorials) for simple examples.

## Fragments

With Fragments, the Activity code typically looks like this:

``` kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), SimpleStateChanger.NavigationHandler {
    private lateinit var fragmentStateChanger: DefaultFragmentStateChanger

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        fragmentStateChanger = DefaultFragmentStateChanger(supportFragmentManager, R.id.container)

        Navigator.configure()
            .setStateChanger(SimpleStateChanger(this))
            .install(this, findViewById(R.id.container), History.of(FirstScreen()))
    }

    override fun onBackPressed() {
        if (!Navigator.onBackPressed(this)) {
            super.onBackPressed()
        }
    }

    override fun onNavigationEvent(stateChange: StateChange) {
        fragmentStateChanger.handleStateChange(stateChange)
    }
}
```

Where `FirstScreen` looks like this (assuming you have `data object` enabled):

```groovy
    kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = "1.8"
    languageVersion = '1.8' // data objects
}
```

```kotlin
// no args
@Parcelize
data object FirstScreen : DefaultFragmentKey() {
    override fun instantiateFragment(): Fragment = FirstFragment()
}
```

If you don't have `data object` support yet, then no-args keys look like this (to ensure stable
hashCode/equals/toString):

``` kotlin
// no args
@Parcelize
data class FirstScreen(private val noArgsPlaceholder: String = ""): DefaultFragmentKey() {
    override fun instantiateFragment(): Fragment = FirstFragment()
}

// has args
@Parcelize
data class FirstScreen(
    val username: String, 
    val password: String,
): DefaultFragmentKey() {
    override fun instantiateFragment(): Fragment = FirstFragment()
}
```

And `FirstFragment` looks like this:

``` kotlin
class FirstFragment: KeyedFragment(R.layout.first_fragment) {
    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)

        val key: FirstScreen = getKey() // params
    }
}
```

After which going to the second screen is as simple as `backstack.goTo(SecondScreen())`.

### Warning regarding integration against OnBackPressedDispatcher

The addition of `OnBackPressedDispatcher` by Jetpack's ComponentActivity effectively breaks all code that ever relied on `onBackPressed()` due to poor design decisions.

This means that in order to use `OnBackPressedDispatcher` in either Fragments or via the `BackHandler` in Compose, we need to adjust the back handling code to use the following, slightly hacky approach:

``` kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), SimpleStateChanger.NavigationHandler {
    private val backPressedCallback = object: OnBackPressedCallback(true) {
        override fun handleOnBackPressed() {
            if (!Navigator.onBackPressed(this@MainActivity)) {
                this.remove() // this is the only safe way to invoke onBackPressed while cancelling the execution of this callback
                onBackPressed() // this is the only safe way to invoke onBackPressed while cancelling the execution of this callback
                this@MainActivity.onBackPressedDispatcher.addCallback(this) // this is the only safe way to invoke onBackPressed while cancelling the execution of this callback
            }
        }
    }

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        // ...
        onBackPressedDispatcher.addCallback(backPressedCallback) // this is required for `onBackPressedDispatcher` to work correctly
        // ...
    }

    @Suppress("RedundantModalityModifier")
    override final fun onBackPressed() { // you cannot use `onBackPressed()` if you use `OnBackPressedDispatcher`
        super.onBackPressed() // `OnBackPressedDispatcher` by Google effectively breaks all usages of `onBackPressed()` because they do not respect the original contract of `onBackPressed()`
    }
}
```

There's a chance that this will unfortunately have to become the "canonical way" of back handling in all libraries that use `onBackPressed()`.

Currently, it only stands here as a "known issue" regarding `OnBackPressedDispatcher` integration.


## Scopes

To simplify sharing data/state between screens, a screen key can implement `ScopeKey`.

The scope is described with a String tag, and services bound to that scope can be configured via `ScopedServices`.

Services bound to a `ServiceBinder` get lifecycle callbacks: `ScopedServices.Registered`, `ScopedServices.Activated`, or `Bundleable`.

This lets you easily share a class between screens, while still letting you handle Android's lifecycles seamlessly.

Using the `simple-stack-extensions`, this can be simplified using the `DefaultServiceProvider`. 

It looks like this:

``` kotlin
Navigator.configure()
    .setScopedServices(DefaultServiceProvider())
    /* ... */
```

And then:


``` kotlin
@Parcelize // typically data class
data object FirstScreen: DefaultFragmentKey(), DefaultServiceProvider.HasServices {
    override fun instantiateFragment(): Fragment = FirstFragment()

    override fun getScopeTag() = toString()

    override fun bindServices(serviceBinder: ServiceBinder) {
        with(serviceBinder) {
            add(FirstScopedModel())
        }
    }
}

class FirstScopedModel : Bundleable, ScopedServices.Registered { // interfaces are optional
    ...
}

class FirstFragment : KeyedFragment(R.layout.first_fragment) {
    private val firstModel by lazy { lookup<FirstScopedModel>() }

    ...
}

class SecondFragment : KeyedFragment(R.layout.second_fragment) {
    private val firstModel by lazy { lookup<FirstScopedModel>() } // <- available if FirstScreen is in the backstack

    ...
}
```

And `FirstScopedModel` is shared between two screens.

Any additional shared scopes on top of screen scopes can be defined using `ScopeKey.Child`.

## What are additional benefits?

Making your navigation state explicit means you're in control of your application.

Instead of hacking around with the right fragment transaction tags, or calling `NEW_TASK | CLEAR_TASK` and making the screen flicker - you can just say `backstack.setHistory(History.of(SomeScreen(), OtherScreen())` and that is now your active navigation history.

Using `Backstack` to navigate allows you to move navigation responsibilities out of your view layer. No need to run FragmentTransactions directly in a click listener each time you want to move to a different screen. No need to mess around with  `LiveData<Event<T>>` or `SingleLiveData` to get your "view" to decide what state your app should be in either.

``` java
class FirstScopedModel(private val backstack: Backstack) {
    fun doSomething() {
        // ...
        backstack.goTo(SecondScreen)
    }
}
```

Another additional benefit is that your navigation history can be unit tested.

``` java
assertThat(backstack.getHistory()).containsExactly(SomeScreen, OtherScreen)
```

And most importantly, navigation (swapping screens) happens in one place, and you are in direct control of what happens in such a scenario. By writing a `StateChanger`, you can set up "how to display my current navigation state" in any way you want. No more `((MainActivity)getActivity()).setTitleText("blah");` inside Fragment's `onStart()`.

Write once, works in all cases.

``` java
override fun onNavigationEvent(stateChange: StateChange) { // using SimpleStateChanger
    val newScreen = stateChange.topNewKey<MyScreen>() // use your new navigation state

    setTitle(newScreen.title);

    ... // set up fragments, set up views, whatever you want
}
```

Whether you navigate forward or backward, or you rotate the screen, or you come back after low memory condition - it's irrelevant. The `StateChanger` will ***always*** handle the scenario in a predictable way.

For an overview of the "why" and the "what" of what Simple-Stack offers, you can check out [this talk called `Simplified Single-Activity Apps using Simple-Stack`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ACcin1Z2HQ).

## What about Jetpack Compose?

See https://github.com/Zhuinden/simple-stack-compose-integration/ for a default way to use composables as screens.

This however is only required if ONLY composables are used, and NO fragments. When using Fragments, refer to the official [Fragment Compose interop](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/interop/interop-apis#compose-in-fragments) guide.

For Fragment + Simple-Stack + Compose integration, you can also check [the corresponding sample](https://github.com/Zhuinden/simple-stack/tree/ced6d11e711fa2dda85e3bd7813cb2a192f10396/samples/advanced-samples/extensions-compose-example).
