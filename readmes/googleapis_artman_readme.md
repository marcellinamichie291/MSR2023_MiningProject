Artman repository is archived
=============================

We no longer use Artman for generating client libraries, and it is not supported.
For generating idiomatic client libraries based on `Protocol Buffers`_ inputs,
consider using the following generators:

- `C#`_
- `Go`_
- `Java`_
- `PHP`_
- `Python`_
- `Ruby`_
- `TypeScript`_

.. _`C#`: https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-csharp
.. _`Go`: https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-go
.. _`Java`: https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-java
.. _`PHP`: https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-php
.. _`Python`: https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-python
.. _`Ruby`: https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-ruby
.. _`TypeScript`: https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-typescript
.. _`Protocol Buffers`: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/

The Artman repository will be archived and later deleted.
