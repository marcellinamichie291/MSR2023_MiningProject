What does this do?
------------------

It is a library to compress and uncompress arrays of integers 
very fast. The assumption is that most (but not all) values in
your array use much less than 32 bits, or that the gaps between
the integers use much less than 32 bits. These sort of arrays often come up
when using differential coding in databases and information
retrieval (e.g., in inverted indexes or column stores).

Please note that random integers are not compressible, by this
library or by any other means. If you ever had the means of
systematically compressing random integers, you could compress
any data source to nothing, by recursive application of your technique. 

This library can decompress integers at a rate of over 1.2 billions per second
(4.5 GB/s). It is significantly faster than generic codecs (such
as Snappy, LZ4 and so on) when compressing arrays of integers.

The library is used in [LinkedIn Pinot](https://github.com/linkedin/pinot), a realtime distributed OLAP datastore.
Part of this library has been integrated in Parquet (http://parquet.io/).
A modified version of the library is included in the search engine 
Terrier (http://terrier.org/). This libary is used by ClueWeb 
Tools (https://github.com/lintool/clueweb). It is also used by [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org).

This library inspired a compression scheme used by Apache Lucene and Apache Lucene.NET (e.g., see
http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_6_1/core/org/apache/lucene/util/PForDeltaDocIdSet.html ).

It is a java port of the fastpfor C++ library (https://github.com/lemire/FastPFor). 
There is also a Go port (https://github.com/reducedb/encoding). The C++
library is used by the zsearch engine (http://victorparmar.github.com/zsearch/)
as well as in GMAP and GSNAP (http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/).


Usage
------

Really simple usage:

```java
        IntegratedIntCompressor iic = new IntegratedIntCompressor();
        int[] data = ... ; // to be compressed
        int[] compressed = iic.compress(data); // compressed array
        int[] recov = iic.uncompress(compressed); // equals to data
```

For more examples, see example.java or the examples folder.

JavaFastPFOR supports compressing and uncompressing data in chunks (e.g., see ``advancedExample`` in [https://github.com/lemire/JavaFastPFOR/blob/master/example.java](example.java)).

Some CODECs ("integrated codecs") assume that the integers are
in sorted orders and use differential coding (they compress deltas). 
They can be found in the package me.lemire.integercompression.differential.
Most others do not.

The Java Team at Intel (R) introduced the vector implementation for FastPFOR
based on the Java Vector API that showed significant gains over the
non-vectorized implementation. For an example usage, see
examples/vector/Example.java. The feature requires JDK 19+.

Maven central repository
------------------------

Using this code in your own project is easy with maven, just add
the following code in your pom.xml file:

```xml
    <dependencies>
         <dependency>
	     <groupId>me.lemire.integercompression</groupId>
	     <artifactId>JavaFastPFOR</artifactId>
	     <version>[0.1,)</version>
         </dependency>
     </dependencies>
```

Naturally, you should replace "version" by the version
you desire.



You can also download JavaFastPFOR from the Maven central repository:
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/me/lemire/integercompression/JavaFastPFOR/


Why?
----

We found no library that implemented state-of-the-art integer coding techniques
such as Binary Packing, NewPFD, OptPFD, Variable Byte, Simple 9 and so on in Java.
We wrote one. 

Thread safety 
----

Some codecs are thread-safe while others are not.
For this reason, it is best to use one codec per thread.
The memory usage of a codec instance is small in any case.

Nevertheless, if you want to reuse codec instances, 
note that by convention, unless the documentation of a codec specify
that it is not thread-safe, then it can be assumed to be thread-safe.

How does it compare to the Kamikaze PForDelta library?
------------------------------------------------------

In our tests, Kamikaze PForDelta is slower than our implementations. See
the benchmarkresults directory for some results.

Requirements
------------

A recent Java compiler. Java 7 or better is recommended.

Good instructions on installing Java 7 on Linux:

How fast is it?
---------------

Compile the code and execute me.lemire.integercompression.benchmarktools.Benchmark.

I recommend running all the benchmarks with the "-server" flag on a desktop machine.

Speed is always reported in millions of integers per second.


For Maven users
---------------

If you are running JDK 19+

```
mvn compile
```

If you are running earlier versions of JDK

```
mvn compiler:compile@default-compile
```

mvn exec:java

For ant users
-------------

If you use Apache ant, please try this:

    $ ant Benchmark

or:

    $ ant Benchmark -Dbenchmark.target=BenchmarkBitPacking
