### Include in your Project

Add this to your root `build.gradle` (usually in the root of your project):

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```

And this to your module `build.gradle` (usually in the `app` directory):

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.rubengees:introduction:2.0.0'
}
```

If that doesn't work, look if there is a new version and the Readme was not updated yet.

If you want to use asynchronous image loading, introduced in the new version 1.1.0, you will need [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) or some other image loading library. If you want to use GIFs you will also need it.

### Usage

Create an `IntroductionBuilder` like the following:

```java
new IntroductionBuilder(this) // this is the Activity you want to start from.
```

Then add some Slides to your Introduction:

```java
new IntroductionBuilder(this).withSlides(generateSlides())
```

```java
private List<Slide> generateSlides() {
    List<Slide> result = new ArrayList<>();

    result.add(new Slide()
            .withTitle("Some title")
            .withDescription("Some description")
            .withColorResource(R.color.green)
            .withImage(R.drawable.myImage)
    );

    result.add(new Slide()
            .withTitle("Another title")
            .withDescription("Another description")
            .withColorResource(R.color.indigo)
            .withImage(R.drawable.myImage2)
    );

    return result;
}
```

Finally introduce yourself!

```java
new IntroductionBuilder(this).withSlides(generateSlides()).introduceMyself();
```

That was easy right?

You can do many customizations, which will be covered by the following.

##### Options

You can let the user make decisions, which you can use like settings.
To do that you add an Option to your slide:

```java
new Slide().withTitle("Feature is doing something")
          .withOption(new Option("Enable the feature"))
          .withColorResource(R.color.orange)
          .withImage(R.drawable.image));
```

When the user completes the intro, you will receive the selected Options in `onActivityResult`.
To read the result:

```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
     if (requestCode == IntroductionBuilder.INTRODUCTION_REQUEST_CODE && resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
         String result = "User chose: ";

         for (Option option : data.<Option>getParcelableArrayListExtra(IntroductionActivity.OPTION_RESULT)) {
            result += option.getPosition() + (option.isActivated() ? " enabled" : " disabled");
        }
     }
}
```

The constant value of the request is 32142, so don't use that yourself.
It is possible that the user cancels the intro. If that happens, the resultCode is `RESULT_CANCELLED` and no Options are passed back.

##### Use Gifs as images

This library supports GIFs. You need to load them asynchronously as the loading may take a while:

```java
new IntroductionBuilder(this)
        .withSlides(slides)
        .withOnSlideListener(new OnSlideListener() {
            @Override
            public void onSlideInit(int position, @Nullable TextView title, @NonNull ImageView image,
                                    @Nullable TextView description) {
                if (position == 1) { // Assume we want to load the GIF at Slide 2 (index 1).
                    Glide.with(image.getContext())
                            .load(R.drawable.image3)
                            .into(image);
                }
            }
        }).introduceMyself();
```

This will add the GIF, which will be automatically played when the users navigates to the Slide.

##### Runtime Permissions

Android Marshmallow introduced Runtime Permissions, which can be requested easily with this lib.
To do that, you can add a global listener like the following:

```java
new IntroductionBuilder(this)
        .withSlides(slides)
        .withOnSlideListener(new OnSlideListener() {
            @Override
            public void onSlideChanged(int from, int to) {
                if (from == 0 && to == 1) {
                    if (ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(MainActivity.this,
                            Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
                        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(MainActivity.this,
                                new String[]{Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE}, 12);
                    }
                }
            }
        }).introduceMyself();
```

You can check if the permissions were granted like the following:

```java
@Override
public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, @NonNull String[] permissions,
                                       @NonNull int[] grantResults) {
    super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);

    if (requestCode == 12) {
        if (grantResults[0] == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
            Toast.makeText(this, "Permission was successfully granted!", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        }
    }
}
```

You can use that listener for different things too, of course!

##### Styles

There are two available styles: `Translucent` and `Fullscreen`.
To apply one of those styles, do the following:

```java
new IntroductionBuilder(this)
                .withSlides(generateSlides())
                .withStyle(new FullscreenStyle())
                .introduceMyself();
```

`Translucent` is the default style.

##### Custom Views

You can supply your own View to a Slide instead of just setting the title, image and description.<br>
This is done like follows:

Create a class which implements CustomViewBuilder:<br>

```java
public class CustomViewBuilderImpl implements Slide.CustomViewBuilder {

    @NonNull
    @Override
    public View buildView(@NonNull LayoutInflater inflater, @NonNull ViewGroup parent) {
        return inflater.inflate(R.layout.layout_custom, parent, false);
    }
}
```

Then set it to your Slide:

```java
new IntroductionBuilder(this)
        .withSlides(new Slide()
                .withCustomViewBuilder(new CustomViewBuilderImpl())
                .withColorResource(R.color.cyan)
        ).introduceMyself();
```

If you set a CustomViewBuilder to your Slide, all other values aside from the color are overridden. You have to manage all on your own.

### Upgrade Guide

#### 1.4.0+ to 2.0.0+

- This library now requires Java 8 (available in the new `Android Studio 3` [toolchain](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support.html)).
- Behaviour change: Not passing a `title`, `description` or `option` hides the respective views. This way you can show fullscreen images.
  - The `title` and `description` parameters of the `onSlideInit` callback are now `@Nullable`
- `CustomViewBuilder` is now in a different package and has been converted into an `interface`.

#### 1.3.9 to 1.4.0+

- `Slide` and `Option` have been moved into a different package. Just let Android Studio re-import them.
- The `OnSlideListener` is now an interface on its own. Remove `IntroductionConfig` before each and let Android Studio re-import. Furthermore `@NotNull` annotations have been added; You should add them to the signature.

#### 1.1.0 to 1.1.1+

- The `OnSlideInit` method in the `OnSlideListener` now comes without the `Fragment context`. If you need a `Context`, call `image.getContext()`.
- There is now a class for Styles instead of an Integer. If you apply no Style, you have to do nothing, if you use one, change it to the following e.g.: `.withStyle(new FullscreenStyle())`.

#### 1.0.x to 1.1.0+

- The `OnSlideChangedListener` was renamed to `OnSlideListener`. Just rename it and it's working again.
- Asynchronous image loading is now available (and recommended!). See the [Use GIFs as drawables](#Use-Gifs-as-images) section for more info. It applies for all types of images. GIFs won't work without asynchronous loading from now on!
