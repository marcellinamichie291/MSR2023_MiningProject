Redline is a pure Java library for manipulating RPM Package Manager packages. Currently the project supports reading and creating packages and has an included Ant task useful for integration with build systems.

To use Redline include it as a Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.redline-rpm</groupId>
	<artifactId>redline</artifactId>
	<version>1.2.10</version>
</dependency>
```

Redline can also be downloaded directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/craigwblake/redline/releases/download/redline-1.2.10/redline-1.2.10-jar-with-dependencies.jar)
