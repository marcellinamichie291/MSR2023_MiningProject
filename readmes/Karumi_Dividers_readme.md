==================

Dividers is an Android library to easily create separators for your RecyclerViews. It supports a wide range of dividers from simple ones, that apply to all your items equally, to a system of selectors that apply different styles to each item.

Usage
-----

The easiest way to start using ``Dividers`` is to create a ``DividerItemDecoration`` with a layer and provide it to your ``RecyclerView`` as follows:

```java
// Create a drawable for your divider
Drawable exampleDrawable = getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.example_drawable);

// Create a DividerItemDecoration instance with a single layer and add it to your recycler view
RecyclerView.ItemDecoration itemDecoration = new DividerItemDecoration(new Layer(DividerBuilder.get().with(exampleDrawable).build()));
recyclerView.addItemDecoration(itemDecoration);
```

If you want to use all the features of ``Dividers`` follow these steps:

* Create a collection of instances of ``Layer`` with the help of ``LayersBuilder`` to define the drawables you want to apply. Each ``Layer`` is composed of:
* An implementation of the ``Selector`` interface, defining which items are going to be affected by the layer. **You can use one of the multiple implementations that come in the library** or create your own.

```java
public class HighRatingMovieSelector implements Selector {

  private final List<Movie> movies;
  private final int maxHighRating;

  public HighRatingMovieSelector(List<Movie> movies, int maxHighRating) {
    this.movies = movies;
    this.maxHighRating = maxHighRating;
  }

  @Override public boolean isPositionSelected(Position position) {
    return movies.get(position.getAbsoluteIndex()).getRating() >= maxHighRating;
  }

  @Override public EnumSet<Direction> getDirectionsByPosition(Position position) {
    return EnumSet.allOf(Direction.class);
  }
}
``` 

* An instance of ``Divider``, containing the drawable that is going to be used to render the separator. Create them using the ``DividerBuilder`` class.

```java
Drawable drawable = getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.example_divider);
Divider divider = DividerBuilder.from(highlightedDrawable).build()
```

* Finally, create a collection of ``Layer`` instances with the help of ``LayersBuilder``

```java
Collection<Layer> layers = LayersBuilder.with(new Layer(new HighRatingMovieSelector(), divider)).build();
```

* Create a new instance of ``DividerItemDecoration`` with your newly created layers.
```java
RecyclerView.ItemDecoration itemDecoration = new DividerItemDecoration(layers);
```
* Add your ``DividerItemDecoration`` to your ``RecyclerView`` using the ``addItemDecoration`` method.
```java
recyclerView.addItemDecoration(itemDecoration);
```

Selectors
-------------

Selectors give you the possibility to apply different configurations to a fixed set of items of your view. There are multiple implementations to apply the same separator to every item in a single row (``AllItemsInRowSelector``) or column (``AllItemsInColumnSelector``).

For example, to show the divider in all the elements except the header you can use the following snippet:
```java
Drawable drawable = getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.example_drawable);

// Create a layer that applies to all the layers. It's the same as writing :
// Layer allItemsLayer = new Layer(new AllItemsSelector(), DividerBuilder.from(drawable).build());
Layer allItemsLayer = new Layer(DividerBuilder.from(drawable).build());

// Create a layer that applies to all the items in the header with an empty drawable to avoid displaying anything
Layer headerLayer = new Layer(new HeaderSelector(), DividerBuilder.fromEmpty().build());

// Add your layers to the DividerItemDecoration class and provide it to your recycler view!
recyclerView.addItemDecoration(new DividerItemDecoration(LayersBuilder.from(allItemsLayer, headerLayer).build()));
```

You can also create your own Selector to apply dividers to all items but the ones in the header:

```java
public class NotInHeaderSelector implements Selector {
  @Override public boolean isPositionSelected(Position position) {
    return !position.isFirstRow();
  }

  @Override public EnumSet<Direction> getDirectionsByPosition(Position position) {
    return EnumSet.allOf(Direction.class);
  }
}
```

As you have seen, selectors also let you apply a divider to some sides of every item depending on things such as the position. In this way you can create selectors to display items as a whole, you can take a look at some examples like ``RowGroupSelector``:

```java
public class RowGroupSelector extends AllItemsInRowSelector {

  protected final int row;

  public RowGroupSelector(int row) {
    this.row = row;
  }

  @Override public boolean isPositionSelected(Position position) {
    return position.getRow() == row;
  }

  @Override public EnumSet<Direction> getDirectionsByPosition(Position position) {
    // Every component of the row will need to draw, at least, SOUTH_WEST, WEST, NORTH_WEST, 
    // NORTH_EAST, EAST and SOUTH_EAST directions
    EnumSet<Direction> directions = EnumSet.complementOf(
        EnumSet.of(Direction.WEST, Direction.EAST));

    // If we are the element of the left side we also need to draw the west direction
    if (position.isFirstColumn()) {
      directions.add(Direction.WEST);
    }
    // If we are the element of the right side we also need to draw the east direction
    if (position.isLastColumn()) {
      directions.add(Direction.EAST);
    }

    return directions;
  }
}
```

Dividers
--------

Dividers are the smallest components that can be rendered and represent all the separators for a single cell. Internally, dividers are represented as a grid of 3x3 elements (ignoring the center). Each side can be referenced with a value from the enum ``Direction``. This can prove useful when defining complex dividers such as the ones used in headers or footers.

Add it to your project
----------------------

Add ``Dividers`` dependency to your ``build.gradle`` file

```groovy

dependencies{
    compile 'com.karumi:dividers:1.0.1'
}

```

or to your ``pom.xml`` if you are using Maven instead of Gradle

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.karumi</groupId>
    <artifactId>dividers</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.1</version>
    <type>aar</type>
</dependency>

```
