## Showcase
### Advanced Demo Application (Beta)
To showcase the different possibilities of this library I've created a demo 'Wallpaper Application'.
You can find the source for this application in the `ps-app/` folder.
In case you want to install the Application, feel free to do so! **It's on Google Playâ„¢**

### Simple Demo Application
You can find a simple demo application in the `app/` folder which you can also download [here](https://github.com/PDDStudio/earthview-android/raw/master/app-debug.apk).

## Getting Started
Include the library into your project by adding the following line to your ```build.gradle```:
```compile 'com.pddstudio:earthview-android:[VERSION]'```
**Note:** *To make sure you're using the latest version, take a look at the maven badge above*

## Usage
 - Implement either `SingleEarthViewCallback` (for a single EarthView) or `EarthViewCallback` (for multiple EarthViews) into your Activity, Adapter or any other class where you want to load the EarthView's.
- Get an instance of the EarthView by calling:
```java
EarthView.withGoogle()
```
- Fire the event which fit's your needs, you'll get the results through the callback interface you provide in your project.

### Fetching a single EarthView

A quick sample to fetch a single EarthView

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements SingleEarthViewCallback {

    Button loadBtn;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        Toolbar toolbar = (Toolbar) findViewById(R.id.toolbar);
        setSupportActionBar(toolbar);

        loadBtn = (Button) findViewById(R.id.load_wall_btn);
        loadBtn.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
	        //in case you want to get a random wallpaper
            EarthView.withGoogle().getRandomEarthWallpaper(MainActivity.this);
	        //in case you want to get a specific EarthWallpaper
		    EarthView.withGoogle().getEarthWallpaper(earthWallpaperIdentifier, this);
            }
        });
    }
    @Override
    public void onStartedLoading() {
        //in case you want to show a loading dialog or anything else
    }

    @Override
    public void onFinishedLoading(EarthWallpaper earthWallpaper) {
        //check whether the result is null or not
        if(earthWallpaper != null) {
            //do whatever you want to do with the EarthWallpaper object
        }
    }


}
```

### Fetching multiple EarthViews

A quick sample to load multiple EarthViews:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements EarthViewCallback {

    Button loadBtn;
   
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        Toolbar toolbar = (Toolbar) findViewById(R.id.toolbar);
        setSupportActionBar(toolbar);

        loadBtn = (Button) findViewById(R.id.load_wall_btn);
        loadBtn.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                EarthView.withGoogle().getAllEarthWallpapers(MainActivity.this);
            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    public void onStartedLoading() {
		//in case you want to show a loading dialog or something else you can do this here
    }

    @Override
    public void onItemLoaded(EarthWallpaper earthWallpaper) {
        //just to be sure the result isn't null
        if(earthWallpaper != null) {
		//here you can handle what you want to do with the new item - this event get's fired every time the library has loaded a new EarthView object
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onFinishedLoading(Collection<EarthWallpaper> earthWallpapers) {
		//here you can stop showing the loading dialog
		//in case you don't want to handle each item seperately the complete Collection of EarthWallpapers is provided here, too 
    }
}
```

## The EarthWallpaper reference sheet
Once you received an EarthWallpaper object through the callback you can get the following information out of it:
- The EarthView's ID (identifier - similar to the original one)
- The EarthView's Slug
- The EarthView's Url (Link to the official Site for this EarthView)
- The EarthView's Title (Official Title for this EarthView)
- The EarthView's Latitude
- The EarthView's Longitude
- The EarthView's Photo Url (In case you want to load it into an ImageView or save it to your storage)
- The EarthView's Thumbnail Url (Recommended when fetching a lot of EarthViews - to reduce bandwith)
- The EarthView's Download Url (The official Url to download this EarthView)
- The EarthView's Region (Region where this EarthView was taken)
- The EarthView's Country (The Country this EarthView was taken)
- The EarthView's Attribution (Copyright information)
- The EarthView's GoogleMaps Url (To show the direct position of this EarthView)

All information can be fetched via their get-Methods.
