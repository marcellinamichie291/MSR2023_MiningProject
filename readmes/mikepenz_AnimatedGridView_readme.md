AnimatedGridView
================

AnimatedGridView extends the default GridView and adds some new functions to animate the deletion of rows.
You just have to choose the AnimatedGridView and extend the AnimatedAdapter (which extends the BaseAdapter).

This library also adds a HeaderGridView, like the normal ListView. The HeaderGridView is from the Google
Source Code of their gallery app.


Including in your project
-------------------------
###Using Maven
AnimatedGridView Library is pushed to [Maven Central], so you just need to add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`.

```javascript
dependencies {
	compile 'com.tundem.widget.gridview:library:1.1.3-SNAPSHOT@aar'
}
```

Usage
-------------------------
### via code or via xml (sample)

```xml
<com.tundem.widget.gridview.AnimatedGridView
    ...
 />
```

### delete fields and animate the gridview
- start the animation by calling following method
```java
animateDeleteCells(mRemovedFieldsToAnimate, 200);
```

- you can also define a listener to do something after the fields were removed
```java
setAnimationListener(new AnimationListener() {
        @Override
        public void onAnimationFinish() {
            ...
	}
});
```

### add fields and animate the gridview
- start the animation by calling following method
```java
//Items to add:
LinkedList<Object> items = new LinkedList<Object>();
items.add(1);
items.add(2);
items.add(3);
items.add(4);
items.add(5);
items.add(6);
//animate the new items
agv.animateAddCells(items, 200);
 ```
