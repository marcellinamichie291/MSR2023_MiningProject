WekaDeeplearning4j gives users the ability to train and test deep learning models from within the Weka environment. Our goal is to make deep learning available to users with zero knowledge of programming. The package uses Deeplearning4j as backend. Weka, and therefore also the WekaDeeplearning4j package, can be accessed via various interfaces. While the main focus of this package is the Weka GUI for users with no programming experience, it is also possible to access the presented features via the Weka commandline line runner as well as from the Weka Java API. Check out the [getting-started](https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/user-guide/getting-started/) tutorials for more information.

The full documentation, giving installation instructions and getting started guides, is available [here](https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/).

## Installation
The package can be installed via the [Weka Package Manager](https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/packages/manager/) GUI. 

Alternatively, the [latest release](https://github.com/Waikato/wekaDeeplearning4j/releases/latest) on GitHub provides the zip file of the package that allow easy installation via the commandline:

```bash
java -cp weka.jar weka.core.WekaPackageManager \
     -install-package package.zip
```

### GPU Support

To add GPU support, [download](https://github.com/Waikato/wekaDeeplearning4j/releases/latest) and run the latest `install-cuda-libs.sh` for Linux/Macosx or `install-cuda-libs.ps1` for Windows. Make sure CUDA is installed on your system as explained [here](https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/install/#gpu).

#### Manual Download

The install script automatically downloads the libraries and copies them into your wekaDeeplearning4j package installation. If you want to download the library zip yourself, choose the appropriate combination of your platform and CUDA version from the [latest release](https://github.com/Waikato/wekaDeeplearning4j/releases/latest) and point the installation script to the file, e.g.:

```bash
./install-cuda.sh ~/Downloads/wekaDeeplearning4j-cuda-10.2-1.60-linux-x86_64.zip
```

## Usage
As most of Weka, WekaDeeplearning4j's functionality is accessible in three ways:

- Using the Weka workbench GUI
- Programming with Weka in Java
- Via the commandline interface

All three ways are explained in the [getting-started](https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/user-guide/getting-started/) documentation. 

Example commandline scripts are provided in the `weka-run-test-scripts` directory, e.g. a simple network with one dense layer of 32 neurons and one output layer, classifying the iris dataset, would look like the following:
```bash
$ java weka.Run \
       .Dl4jMlpClassifier \
       -layer "weka.dl4j.layers.DenseLayer -nOut 32 -activation \"weka.dl4j.activations.ActivationReLU \" " \
       -layer "weka.dl4j.layers.OutputLayer -activation \"weka.dl4j.activations.ActivationSoftmax \" " \
       -numEpochs 30 \
       -t datasets/nominal/iris.arff
```

which results in:

```

=== Confusion Matrix ===

  a  b  c   <-- classified as
 50  0  0 |  a = Iris-setosa
  0 44  6 |  b = Iris-versicolor
  0  3 47 |  c = Iris-virginica
```

The same setup can be achieved in Java with the following code:
```java
// Setup layers
DenseLayer dense = new DenseLayer();
dense.setNOut(32);
OutputLayer out = new OutputLayer();
        
// Setup MLP
Dl4jMlpClassifier mlp = new Dl4jMlpClassifier();
mlp.setLayers(dense, out);
        
// Build model
mlp.buildClassifier(loadIris());
```
