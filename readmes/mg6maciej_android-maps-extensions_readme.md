Library extending capabilities of Google Maps Android API v2.  
While [Google Maps Android API v2](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/)
is a huge leap forward comapared to its predecessor,
it lacks commonly used patterns like marker clustering.
This library aims to fill this gap by adding many useful features
and improving on the responsiveness issues of the official Google library.  
See [wiki](https://github.com/mg6maciej/android-maps-extensions/wiki) for more details.
