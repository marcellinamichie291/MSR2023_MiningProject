### Statistics
PacketEvents collects statistics anonymously using bStats. It helps give us an overview of what platforms use our project. If you really don't like, you can turn it off.

### Credit
PacketEvents uses an injector that is extremely similar to ViaVersion's injector. I have included license and copyright holder notice in the files taken from ViaVersion. Thank you ViaVersion.
