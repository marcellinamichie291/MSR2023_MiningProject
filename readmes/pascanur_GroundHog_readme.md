GroundHog
=========

This library is built on top of Theano
(http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) and can be used with Jobman
(http://deeplearning.net/software/jobman/).  It is meant to provide a
flexible yet efficient way of implementing complex recurrent models.
Currently it supports variations of recurrent neural networks (such as
DT-RNN, DOT-RNN, RNN Encoder-Decoder) and stacked version of them. 

Most of the library documentation is still work in progress, but check the
files containing Tut (in scripts) for a quick tutorial on how to use the
library.

The library was developed at University of Montreal, in Lisa lab
(http://lisa.iro.umontreal.ca/index\_en.html). Among the main contributors 
are Razvan Pascanu, KyungHyun Cho and Caglar Gulcehre. 

The library is under the 3-clause BSD license, so it may be used for
commercial purposes.
