Disclaimer
----------

Fatiando is under active development and we are still changing the API between
releases.
Names will change and functions will move as we improve our design.
You might have to update your scripts and notebooks to get the latest features
from a new release.

Please bear with us.


Overview
--------

Our goal is provide a comprehensive and extensible framework
for geophysical data analysis and the development of new methodologies.

**Research:**
Make your research more **reproducible** by writing a Python script or Jupyter
notebook instead of clicking through complicated menus.

**Development:**
Don't start from scratch! Build upon the existing tools in Fatiando to develop
new methods.

**Teaching:**
Combine Fatiando with the Jupyter notebook to make rich, interactive documents.
Great for teaching fundamental concepts of geophysics!


Getting started
---------------

1. `Install Fatiando <http://www.fatiando.org/install.html>`__ and its
   dependencies.
2. Browse the `Gallery <http://www.fatiando.org/gallery/index.html>`__ 
   for examples of what Fatiando can do.
3. Take a look at the rest of the 
   `Documentation <http://www.fatiando.org/docs.html>`__ for
   more information about the library.
4. Get involved in the community and see how you can help
   in our `Contributor Guide <http://www.fatiando.org/develop.html>`__.


Contributing and asking for help
---------------------------------

**Subscribe** to our Google Groups mailing list to stay informed and ask for
help:
`groups.google.com/d/forum/fatiando <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/fatiando>`__

We'll post updates to the list about new releases and features, events, and
future plans for the project.
**Get involved** to help us shape the project and make it even better!

Another option for reaching out and reporting bugs is to
`open an issue on Github <https://github.com/fatiando/fatiando/issues>`__.

We have an **open development** process where everything is discussed through
`Github issues <https://github.com/fatiando/fatiando/issues>`__. Anyone can
comment and give feedback. See our `Roadmap for v1.0
<https://github.com/fatiando/fatiando/issues/102>`__ to get a feeling for where
the project is headed. **Your input is welcome!**

    Earth with Fatiando a Terra, Proceedings of the 12th Python in Science
    Conference, pp. 91 - 98.

Please also **cite the method papers** of individual functions/classes.
References are available in the documentation of each module/function/class.

See the `CITATION.rst
<https://github.com/fatiando/fatiando/blob/master/CITATION.rst>`__ file or the
`Citing section <http://www.fatiando.org/cite.html>`__ of the docs for more
information.

You can also show your support by buying a **sticker** `from Stickermule 
<https://www.stickermule.com/marketplace/16580-fatiando-a-terra>`__.
We don't make any money from the sales but it helps spread the word about the 
project.
