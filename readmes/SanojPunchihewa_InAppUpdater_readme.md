<h1 align="center">InAppUpdater</h1>
<p align="center">Android Library to easily implement <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/in-app-updates">in-app updates</a></p>

## :pencil2: Usage

### Step 1: Add it in your root build.gradle
```Gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```
### Step 2: Add the dependency
```Gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.SanojPunchihewa:InAppUpdater:1.0.5'
}
```

### Step 3: Initialize the UpdateManager
Declare the UpdateManager in your Activity
```java
    // Declare the UpdateManager
    UpdateManager mUpdateManager;
```
Initialize the UpdateManager in your `onCreate` method of the Activity
```java
    // Initialize the Update Manager with the Activity and the Update Mode
    mUpdateManager = UpdateManager.Builder(this).mode(UpdateManagerConstant.FLEXIBLE);
    mUpdateManager.start();
```

**Update Mode**

There are two modes
* Flexible(`UpdateManagerConstant.FLEXIBLE`) *(default)* - User can use the app during update download, installation and restart needs to be triggered by user

* Immediate(`UpdateManagerConstant.IMMEDIATE`) - User will be blocked until download and installation is finished, restart is triggered automatically

**Additionally** you can get the Available Version Code of the update and the Number of days passed since the user was notified of an update through the Google Play. You can find these codes in the [demo app](/app/src/main/java/com/zanojmobiapps/inappupdatedemoapp/MainActivity.java)

```java
mUpdateManager.addUpdateInfoListener(new UpdateInfoListener() {
    @Override
    public void onReceiveVersionCode(final int code) {
        // You can get the available version code of the apk in Google Play
        // Do something here
    }

    @Override
    public void onReceiveStalenessDays(final int days) {
        // Number of days passed since the user was notified of an update through the Google Play
        // If the user hasn't notified this will return -1 as days
        // You can decide the type of update you want to call
    }
});
```

**Monitoring the flexible update download progres**

You can monitor the download progress of a Flexible Update using this callback.
***Note***: This is only available for Flexible update mode. You can find more from the [official doc](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates#monitor_flexible)
```java
// Callback from Flexible Update Progress
mUpdateManager.addFlexibleUpdateDownloadListener(new FlexibleUpdateDownloadListener() {
    @Override
    public void onDownloadProgress(final long bytesDownloaded, final long totalBytes) {
       // Show a progress bar or anything you want
    }
});
```

## :exclamation: Troubleshoot
- In-app updates works only with devices running **Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher**
- In-app updates are available only to user accounts that own the app. So, **make sure the account youâ€™re using has downloaded your app from Google Play at least once before using the account to test in-app updates.**
- Make sure that the app that you are testing in-app updates with has the **same application ID and is signed with the same signing key** as the one available from Google Play.
- Because Google Play can only update an app to a higher version code, make sure the app you are **testing as a lower version code than the update version code.**
