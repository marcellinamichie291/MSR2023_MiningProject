PlayN is a cross-platform Java game development library written in [Java] that targets HTML5
browsers (via [GWT]), desktop JVMs, [Android] and [iOS] devices.

# NOTE

This is the legacy 1.x version of the PlayN library which is no longer actively developed. Active
development is happening on PlayN 2.x which is hosted at [playn/playn].

Unless you mean to be using the legacy 1.x version of PlayN (and potentially submitting bug fix or
other maintenance patches), you should immediately proceed to the 2.x site.
