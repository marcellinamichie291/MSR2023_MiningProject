HPOlib: A hyperparameter optimization library.
===============================================================

This package is discontinued. We have merged all changes that we have done since the initial release into the master branch, hoping that they are useful for some of you. The current software has several known bugs, which can be found in the issue tracker. In case someone wants to continue working on HPOlib, we're happy to answer questions, accept and merge pull requests. If you're looking for a set of benchmarks, please use the predecessor [HPOlib2](https://github.com/automl/HPOlib2). HPOlib2 does not contain any optimization packages. We will add a list of Bayesian optimization packages to the documentation of HPOlib2.
 
This software provides a commen interface to the three hyperparameter
Optimization packages hyperopt (TPE), SMAC and spearmint. For further information,
please visit the accompanying website http://www.automl.org/hpolib. The
documentation can be found at [http://hpolib.readthedocs.org](http://hpolib.readthedocs.org).
